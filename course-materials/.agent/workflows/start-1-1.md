**Do this SILENTLY:**

1. Read `lesson-modules/1.1-welcome/SCRIPT.md` - this is your teaching script

2. Read `.agent/rules/SCRIPT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for critical teaching rules

3. Follow the teaching script precisely as instructed:
   - Deliver no-prefix text naturally to students
   - Stop at "STOP:" points and wait
   - Execute "ACTION:" blocks as specified
   - Start teaching immediately (no meta-commentary)
