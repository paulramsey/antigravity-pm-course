# Module 1.3: Your First PM Tasks

Welcome to Module 1.3: Your First PM Tasks. In Module 1.2 you learned the Antigravity interface - file explorer, conversation view, @ mentions. Now you're going to use those skills for REAL PM work. No practice exercises - actual tasks PMs do every day.

**STOP: Ready to do some real work?**

**USER: Yes / Ready**

---

Today you'll learn three common PM workflows. First: Taking messy meeting notes and cleaning them up. Second: Transforming notes into polished deliverables. Third: Analyzing multiple files to find insights. These are things you'll do constantly as a PM.

**STOP: Sound good?**

**USER: Confirms**

**Scenario 1: Append to Existing File**

Imagine: You just got out of a product strategy meeting. You took rough notes during the call - they're a bit messy. You need to add a clean summary to the bottom of those notes for your team. Let's do that now. In the file explorer, find lesson-modules/1.3-first-tasks/meeting-notes-raw.md. (Pro tip: You can also click on file links directly in the chat when I mention them!)

**STOP: Do you see it?**

**USER: Yes**

---

Great! Open it and skim through it. These are realistic rough notes - typos, incomplete thoughts, stream of consciousness. But you need a clean summary at the bottom to share with your team. Let's have Antigravity add that for you.

**STOP: Type this command: "Read @meeting-notes-raw.md and append a clean summary section to the bottom of the file"**

**USER: Types and sends command**

**ACTION: Read the file and append summary section**

---

Perfect! Look at what just happened above in this pane and in the file itself at the bottom. You should see me proposing changes to meeting-notes-raw.md. This is the **Apply/Reject workflow** - super important for PMs. You can review each change before accepting it. For most PM tasks, "Accept All" is totally fine. But you CAN reject specific changes if something looks wrong.

**STOP: Do you see the proposed changes?**

**USER: Confirms**

---

Go ahead and click "Accept All" (or review and accept individually if you prefer).

**STOP: Did the changes get applied?**

**USER: Confirms**

---

Awesome! That's workflow #1: editing existing files in-place.

**STOP: Ready for the next one?**

**USER: Confirms**

---

**Scenario 2: Transform to New File**

New scenario: You have notes from a product sync meeting. You need to send an executive summary email to your VP. You don't want to edit the original notes - you want a NEW file in email format. Let's do that. In the file explorer, find and open lesson-modules/1.3-first-tasks/product-sync-notes.md.

**STOP: Do you see it?**

**USER: Yes**

---

Great!

**STOP: Type this: "Read @product-sync-notes.md and create a new file called product-sync-email.md formatted as an executive email summary"**

**USER: Types and sends command**

**ACTION: Read product-sync-notes.md and create product-sync-email.md**

---

Look - I just created a BRAND NEW file, instead of editing the existing one. You should see the Apply/Reject workflow again. This time for creating a new file. Accept the changes.

**STOP: Do you see the file?**

**USER: Confirms**

---

Open it up - see how it's formatted as a polished email, not rough notes? (Remember: You can preview markdown files nicely with Cmd+Shift+V on Mac or Ctrl+Shift+V on Windows!) That's the key difference: Scenario 1 edited the existing file, but this created a NEW file. Same input (notes), different output format (email). This is the general workflow for creating new documents. And with @ mentioning, you can easily give me whatever context I need to create them. Pay attention to this pattern! So that's workflow #2: creating new files.

**STOP: Ready for the next one?**

**USER: Confirms**

**Scenario 3: Folder Analysis to New File**

Final scenario: You conducted 8 user interviews this week. Each interview is in a separate file. You need to synthesize all 8 into one insights document. This is where @ mentions get REALLY powerful. In the file explorer, find lesson-modules/1.3-first-tasks/user-interviews/. Expand that folder.

**STOP: How many interview files do you see?**

**USER: 8 files**

---

Exactly! You could @ mention each file individually... but there's a better way. You can @ mention the ENTIRE FOLDER.

**STOP: Type this: "Analyze all files in @user-interviews and create a new file called user-research-insights.md with the top 3 pain points and supporting quotes"**

**USER: Types and sends command**

---

**ACTION: Read all 8 interview files and create synthesis document**

Done! I just read all 8 files and synthesized them into one document. This is HUGE for PMs - you can analyze dozens of files in seconds.

**STOP: Do you see the new insights file being proposed? Go ahead and accept the change.**

**USER: Confirms**

---

Open user-research-insights.md in the editor. This is a synthesis of 8 separate interviews - I read all 8 files and pulled out the key themes.

**STOP: Do you see the top pain points with supporting quotes?**

**USER: Confirms**

---

Perfect! You just did multi-file analysis.

---

Let's recap what you learned. Scenario 1: Append to existing file (in-place editing). Scenario 2: Transform to new file (read one, create another). Scenario 3: Folder analysis (read many, synthesize one). These three patterns cover 80% of PM work in Antigravity.

**STOP: Make sense?**

**USER: Confirms**

---

Here's the key insight: @ mentions + clear instructions = powerful PM workflows. You can edit existing docs, create new formatted outputs, or analyze multiple files. The Apply/Reject workflow lets you review before accepting. In practice, you'll mostly Accept All for PM tasks.

**STOP: Any questions about these workflows?**

**USER: Questions or confirms**

---

Fantastic! You just did real PM work. You cleaned up meeting notes, created an executive email, and synthesized user research. In Module 1.4, you'll learn how to use templates for consistent formatting.

**STOP: Ready to move on?**

**USER: Confirms**

---

Perfect! You're ready for Module 1.4. When you're ready for the next module, type: /start-1-4. See you there!
