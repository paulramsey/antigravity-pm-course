# Research: Presentation Best Practices for PM Feature Pitches

## Overview
This document synthesizes research on best practices for product manager presentations, particularly for feature proposals and interview presentations. Based on McKinsey/BCG consulting standards, PM interview research, and pitch deck design principles.

---

## 1. ACTION TITLES (McKinsey/BCG Standard)

### The Core Principle

**Rule:** Every slide title should be a **complete declarative statement** that conveys the key insight or takeaway.

**Origin:** McKinsey and BCG use "action titles" - short, simple sentences that convey the main takeaway or 'so what' of the slide, allowing the audience to understand the primary message by only reading the title.

**Why "Action" Titles?**
They're called 'action' titles because they actively tell the audience what the key takeaway is, in contrast to conventional slide titles that simply summarize content topics.

---

### Key Characteristics

**Length and Format:**
- Action titles should be concise, **less than 15 words** for each slide
- Typically about **5-6 words long**, written in a concise and to-the-point fashion
- No more than two lines is preferred
- Use active voice and declarative statements

**The "Slide Titles Only" Test:**
- If a reader only goes through the action titles of each slide, it should convey the **complete story** to them
- BCG consultants are trained to write slides and summaries that allow someone to understand a presentation by only reading the titles of each slide

---

### Best Practice: Write Titles First

Best practice when crafting action titles is to **write them as the first step** of creating a presentation, ensuring the presentation is cohesive and clear from the beginning.

**Workflow:**
1. Outline your argument
2. Write slide titles as declarative statements
3. Review titles to ensure they tell complete story
4. THEN fill in supporting content

**Source:** Multiple consulting presentation guides

---

### Examples: Good vs. Bad

**❌ BAD - Topic Labels:**
- "The Problem"
- "Background"
- "Our Solution"
- "Metrics"
- "Next Steps"

**❌ BAD - Questions:**
- "How Can We Improve Chess Learning?"
- "What's the Opportunity?"
- "Why Should We Build This?"

**✅ GOOD - Action Statements:**
- "Puzzle-Only Learning Limits Chess Improvement"
- "Coach Mode Finds Tactics in Real Games"
- "Max AI Features Drive 6% ARPU Growth"
- "Conservative Model: $1.2M Revenue in Year One"
- "Four-Month Build Delivers Fast ROI"

**Why Good Works:**
- Each title tells you THE INSIGHT
- Reading just titles = understanding full argument
- Forces clarity of thinking
- Makes slides "scannable" for executives

---

## 2. ONE IDEA PER SLIDE

### The Core Principle

**Rule:** Each slide should have **one clear takeaway**. If you're squeezing in multiple ideas, break them up.

**Why It Matters:**
- Simpler slides = a smoother, more engaging pitch
- Multiple ideas across one slide leads to confusion and problems communicating
- A single idea is the easiest to express and the easiest to understand
- Avoiding confusion is key to imparting your vision

### Design Implications

**Minimalist Design Principles:**
- Prioritize clean layouts
- Ample white space
- Focus on one central message per slide
- Use a single, strong visual where possible
- Embrace white space

**Text Usage:**
Aim for one main idea per slide, supported by a few key points. Minimal text helps make it easier for the audience to scan and absorb the key messages quickly.

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Investors/executives should be able to grasp key points at a glance
- Clean layouts, whitespace, and well-placed visuals are a must

---

### Common Violations to Avoid

**❌ Slide Tries to Cover:**
- Problem definition
- Market size
- Competitive landscape
- ALL on one slide

**✅ Instead, Break Into:**
- Slide 1: The problem (one clear pain point)
- Slide 2: Market opportunity (size and growth)
- Slide 3: Competitive gap (what's missing)

**❌ Feature Slide Tries to Cover:**
- How it works
- Why users will love it
- Technical architecture
- Design mockups
- ALL on one slide

**✅ Instead, Break Into:**
- Slide 1: Core concept + main visual
- Slide 2: User experience flow
- Slide 3: Technical feasibility

## 4. THE 4Ps FRAMEWORK

### Overview

The 4Ps framework — **Problem, Promise, Proof, Proposal** — is a recommended structure for case study presentations that creates a persuasive narrative arc.

**Source:** SlideModel: "How to Write and Present a Case Study"
- URL: https://slidemodel.com/case-study-how-to-write-and-present-it/

---

### The Framework Explained

**1. PROBLEM** (Set the Scene)
- What's broken or missing?
- Who's affected and how?
- Why does this matter NOW?
- Quantify the pain

**Example for Coach Mode:**
- "Chess players who only do puzzles never truly improve at playing games"
- "Duolingo Chess has millions of users but zero premium features"

---

**2. PROMISE** (How You'll Solve It)
- Your solution in clear terms
- The core insight or approach
- Why your solution is elegant/different
- What users will experience

**Example for Coach Mode:**
- "Coach Mode finds tactics IN your games, not just isolated puzzles"
- "Uses Duolingo's proven AI coaching model applied to chess"

---

**3. PROOF** (Evidence It Will Work)
- Data from research
- Analogies to successful features
- User testimonials (if available)
- Different scenarios showing robustness
- Numbers: market size, conversion estimates, ROI

**Example for Coach Mode:**
- "Max AI features drove 6% ARPU growth"
- "Video Call sees 2× usage among engaged learners"
- "Chess research proves: games + coaching beats puzzles alone"

---

**4. PROPOSAL** (Next Steps & Ask)
- What you're asking for (approval, resources, green light)
- Clear next steps
- Timeline
- How you'll validate
- Vision for future

**Example for Coach Mode:**
- "4-month build, phased launch, clear success metrics"
- "Conservative model: $1.2M Year 1 revenue"
- "This makes Chess a Max revenue driver"

---

### Why 4Ps Works

**Creates Persuasive Arc:**
1. Establishes urgency (Problem)
2. Offers hope (Promise)
3. Builds credibility (Proof)
4. Enables decision (Proposal)

**Matches Mental Model:**
- Executives think: "What's wrong? How do we fix it? Why will it work? What's the ask?"
- 4Ps directly answers these questions in sequence

**Forces Clarity:**
- Can't hide weak thinking in fluff
- Each P requires concrete, defensible content

---

## 5. SPECIFIC PM INTERVIEW INSIGHTS (2024-2025)

### Recent Trends

**Presentation Round Growth:**
- As of April 2025, approximately **10% of PM roles require presentations**
- **70% of CPO roles** require presentations
- Becoming "the biggest trend in Product Management job hunting"
- Called "the dreaded presentation round"

**Source:** News.aakashg.com: "How to Ace the Presentation Round of PM Interviews"
- URL: https://www.news.aakashg.com/p/presentation-pm

---

### Format Expectations

**Length:**
- Presentations don't need to be long
- Should contain **original thought**
- "A few slides" is often sufficient (typical: 8-12 slides)
- Time: Usually 30-45 minutes including Q&A

**Preparation:**
- Candidates asked to prepare for second interview
- Should feel comfortable with material (practice!)
- Expect to be interrupted with questions

---

### Content Requirements

**NOT Purely Informational:**
❌ "Here are five trends in dating apps" (just observations)

**SHOULD Reach Conclusion and Make Argument:**
✅ "Here are the two trends most likely to impact your dating app's growth" (analysis + recommendation)

**Key Quote:**
> "Presentations shouldn't be purely informational but should require reaching a conclusion and making a compelling argument."

**Source:** PM Interview Research (multiple sources)

---

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**1. Too Much Text on Slides**
- Don't cram slides with paragraphs
- Use bullet points, headings, simple charts
- Slides support your talk; they're not a document

**2. Missing the "So What?"**
- Don't just describe features
- Explain WHY it matters
- Connect to business outcomes

**3. Weak Problem Statement**
- Vague: "Chess could be better"
- Strong: "75% puzzle focus misses how people actually improve at chess"

**4. No Trade-off Discussion**
- Shows immature thinking if you claim "no downsides"
- Acknowledge what you're NOT doing
- Explain why your choice is right

**5. Unrealistic Scope**
- "This will take 6 months and 10 engineers"
- Better: "4-month build with 2-3 engineers, here's the MVP scope"

---

### The Power of Presentation Quality

**Key Insight:**
> "There is power in how you as a product manager convey your ideas and messaging. Even with great discovery and validation, ineffective presentation may prevent getting the green light."

**What This Means:**
- A good idea poorly presented = No
- A decent idea excellently presented = Maybe/Yes
- A great idea excellently presented = Strong Yes

**Implication:**
- **Invest time in presentation craft**
- Practice delivery multiple times
- Get feedback on slides before the interview
- Polish matters

---

## 6. SLIDE DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### Visual Hierarchy

**Use the Z-Pattern or F-Pattern:**
- Eyes scan top-left → top-right → bottom-left → bottom-right (Z)
- Or: Top-left → scan down left side → scan right as interested (F)
- Place most important info where eyes naturally go first

**Title Dominance:**
- Action title = most prominent text on slide
- Should be readable from back of room
- Bold, larger font than body text

---

### Typography

**Font Choices:**
- Sans-serif for modern, clean feel (Helvetica, Arial, Calibri)
- Consistent font family throughout deck
- Max 2 fonts (one for titles, one for body)

**Font Sizes:**
- Title: 32-44pt
- Body: 18-24pt
- Captions: 14-16pt
- Anything smaller = unreadable

---

### Color Usage

**Limited Palette:**
- 2-3 primary colors max
- Use brand colors if presenting to company
- High contrast (dark text on light background, or vice versa)
- Use color strategically to highlight key points

**Accessibility:**
- Ensure sufficient contrast ratios
- Don't rely on color alone to convey meaning
- Test slides in grayscale to check readability

---

### Data Visualization

**Chart Best Practices:**
- Label axes clearly
- Include units ($, %, etc.)
- Highlight the insight (use color, arrows, annotations)
- Keep it simple - if chart needs explanation, simplify it

**When to Use Each Chart Type:**
- **Bar chart:** Comparing categories
- **Line chart:** Trends over time
- **Pie chart:** Parts of a whole (max 5 slices)
- **Table:** Precise numbers, comparisons

---

### White Space

**The 30% Rule:**
- Aim for ~30% of slide to be white space
- Prevents cramped, overwhelming feeling
- Guides eye to important elements

**Breathing Room:**
- Don't fill every pixel
- Margins around edges
- Space between elements
- Let your content breathe

---

## 7. MONETIZATION PRESENTATION SPECIFICS

### Components to Include

When presenting a monetization-focused feature (like Coach Mode), ensure these elements are covered:

**1. Feature Description**
- Describe your proposed scheme
- Details of new product features to be built
- Marketing strategy
- Relevant partnerships

**2. Revenue Estimation**
- Build 3-year revenue estimation model
- Provide all calculations underlying assumptions
- Show your work in as much detail as available
- Conservative and upside scenarios

**3. Metrics**
- What metrics would you track?
- How do you know feature is performing adequately?
- What would you investigate if metrics underperform?
- What changes would you make?

**4. Impact Assessment**
- Would your feature have any negative impacts?
- Even minor ones?
- Shows mature, balanced thinking
- Demonstrates you've considered trade-offs

**Source:** Medium: "Clearing the Product Management Case study round"
- URL: https://sushantkr17.medium.com/clearing-the-product-management-case-study-round-sample-solution-91dcbe677f4b

---

### Revenue Model Best Practices

**Show Your Assumptions Clearly:**
- "Assumption 1: 2M chess DAUs (conservative from 'millions' mentioned)"
- "Assumption 2: 0.5% conversion rate (conservative vs Video Call)"
- "Assumption 3: $120/year Max subscription price"

**Build From Bottom Up:**
```
2M DAUs × 0.5% conversion = 10K new Max subs
10K subs × $120/year = $1.2M incremental revenue
```

**Provide Context:**
- Compare to existing features
- Reference benchmarks (Video Call drove Max from 5% → 8%)
- Show sensitivity analysis (what if conversion is 1%? 3%?)

---

## 8. DUOLINGO-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS

### Company Culture

**Known For:**
- Quirky, fun, irreverent brand

## 9. DELIVERY TIPS

### Presentation Flow

**Opening (30 seconds):**
- Brief intro: Your name, what you're presenting
- Roadmap: "Today I'll cover the problem, solution, business case, and next steps"
- Hook: "Chess has millions of Duolingo users but contributes zero revenue - let's fix that"

**Body (25-30 minutes):**
- Follow your slide structure
- Don't read slides - elaborate on them
- Use slides as visual anchor, not script
- Transition smoothly: "Now that we've seen the problem, let me show you how Coach Mode solves it..."

**Closing (2 minutes):**
- Recap key points quickly
- Clear call to action: "I recommend we green-light Coach Mode for Q2 launch"
- Open for questions confidently

---

### Handling Questions

**During Presentation:**
- If interrupted, answer briefly then return to flow
- "Great question - I actually cover that on slide 7, but the short answer is..."
- Don't get derailed by tangents

**Q&A Period:**
- Repeat question for clarity (and to buy thinking time)
- Be honest if you don't know: "I don't have that data, but here's how I'd approach finding it..."
- Connect answers back to your main points
- Show intellectual humility and curiosity

---

### Practice Recommendations

**Run Through 3-5 Times:**
1. First time: Just you, slides, out loud
2. Second time: Record yourself, watch for filler words
3. Third time: Friend/colleague, get feedback
4. Fourth time: Simulate pressure (stand up, formal setting)
5. Fifth time: Final polish, timing check

**Time Management:**
- Aim to finish 5 minutes early (buffer for questions)
- Know which slides you can skip if running long
- Have a "lightning round" version ready (if they say "we only have 20 minutes")

---
