## Teaching Flow

Welcome to Module 1.4: Communication Styles - The PM Superpower

In this module you'll learn how to use templates to get consistent, professional communication formats every time

You'll transform the same information into three different formats: Slack updates, executive emails, and Notion docs

**STOP: Ready to learn this PM superpower?**

**USER: Ready**

---

Great! Let me show you three pre-made communication style templates

These templates give you EXACTLY the format you want, every single time

Plus, you can iterate and refine them over time to make them perfect

You'll use these for different PM audiences throughout your work

**ACTION: List files in lesson-modules/1.4-communication-styles/communication-styles/ folder**

**STOP: Do you see the three style template files?**

**USER: Confirms**

---

Let's look at these templates to see how they differ

**ACTION: Read all three style template files and present them**
	- style-slack-update.md
	- style-executive-email.md
	- style-notion-doc.md

Notice the differences in format:
	- Slack: casual, 2-3 lines, emoji-friendly, scannable
	- Email: strategic, 3 paragraphs, executive-focused
	- Notion: comprehensive, formatted with headers, detailed

Same information, three totally different formats for different audiences

**STOP: Make sense? Each audience gets exactly what they need**

**USER: Confirms**

---

Now let's practice using templates with a real example

You have meeting notes from a product sync that need summarizing

Without a template, the format would be inconsistent every time you ask

With a template, you get exactly the format you want

Here's the key: you'll use @ mentions to reference BOTH files - the meeting notes AND the template

**STOP: Ask me to: "Append a summary to @meeting-notes-product-sync.md using the format from @style-slack-update.md"**

**USER: Append a summary to @meeting-notes-product-sync.md using the format from @style-slack-update.md**

**ACTION: Read meeting-notes-product-sync.md and style-slack-update.md, then edit meeting-notes-product-sync.md to append a summary formatted according to the template**

Done! I just appended a summary using the Slack template

**STOP: Do you see the summary? Notice how it follows the template's format exactly**

**USER: Confirms**

---

With templates, you get that quality EVERY time

Even better - you can refine the template once, and all future outputs improve

That's the PM superpower: build a workflow once, reuse forever

**STOP: Does that click? Templates equal consistency plus reusability**

**USER: Confirms**

---

Now let's do something really powerful

You have research findings that need to be shared with different audiences

Transform the same information into all THREE communication formats at once

Slack update for your team, email for execs, Notion doc for the wiki

Same research, three audiences, zero manual rewriting

You'll use @ mentions to reference both the research file AND the templates folder

**STOP: Ask me to: "Transform @research-findings.md into three formats using the templates in @communication-styles/"**

**USER: Transform @research-findings.md into three formats using the templates in @communication-styles/**

**ACTION: Read research-findings.md and all three template files, then create three new output files**
	- slack-update-output.md (research formatted in Slack style)
	- executive-email-output.md (research formatted in Email style)
	- notion-doc-output.md (research formatted in Notion style)

Done! I just created three versions of your research, each tailored to a different audience

**STOP: Do you see all three files? Same research, totally different formats for different audiences**

**USER: Confirms**

---

So when would you actually use this as a PM?

Scenario 1: User research findings - Slack for team, email for leadership, Notion for documentation

Scenario 2: Feature launch updates - different formats for engineering, sales, execs

Scenario 3: Quarterly planning - transform strategy doc into stakeholder-specific formats

The pattern: write once or gather once, then distribute in formats tailored to each audience

**STOP: Does this make sense?**

**USER: Confirms**

---

Here's why this is a superpower

You create a template once, then refine it over time

Every time you use it, you might tweak it slightly to make it better

After a few iterations, you have the PERFECT template for that audience

Then you reuse it forever - instant, consistent, professional communication

As a PM, you'll build a library of these templates for different scenarios

It's like having a communication toolkit that gets better over time

**STOP: Questions about templates or communication styles?**

**USER: Responds**

---

Awesome! Let's recap what you learned

You can use @ mentions to reference multiple files at once (content + template)

Templates give you consistent, professional formatting every time

Same information can be transformed into different formats for different audiences

You can iterate and refine templates over time to make them perfect

This pattern works for any PM communication: PRDs, status updates, research summaries

In Module 1.5, you'll learn about Antigravity's three modes: Ask, Agent, and Plan

**STOP: Any questions before we wrap up?**

**USER: Questions or ready to continue**

Perfect! You're ready for Module 1.5
