# Dark Mode Feature Research - May 2024

**Author:** Sarah Chen, Senior PM
**Last Updated:** May 15, 2024

## Overview
Research findings from 15 enterprise customer interviews exploring dark mode as a potential Q2 feature. This doc consolidates findings, analyzes business impact, and provides recommendations for roadmap prioritization.

## Background / Context
Dark mode surfaced in Q1 sales calls as a common enterprise request. We conducted structured research to validate demand and understand use cases before committing engineering resources.

**Related docs:**
- [Q2 Roadmap Planning](link)
- [Enterprise Customer Feedback Log](link)

## Key Findings

### User Demand
- 15/15 enterprise customers interviewed
- 12/15 mentioned dark mode unprompted as top request
- $450K ARR represented in interview cohort
- 3 customers explicitly tied renewals to feature

### Use Cases
**After-hours work:** 80% of enterprise users work outside 9-5
- Async teams across timezones
- Late-night planning sessions
- Early morning review sessions

**Eye strain concerns:** Universal pain point
- Quoted: "Our engineers work late. Dark mode isn't luxury, it's health" - DataCorp VP Eng

### Competitive Context
- Asana: Full dark mode, shipped 2022
- Linear: Dark mode default, highly praised
- Notion: System-based dark mode
- **TaskFlow: None** ← competitive gap

## Implications

This isn't a design preference - it's a barrier to enterprise adoption:
1. **Expansion risk:** 3 customers waiting on this for broader rollout
2. **Competitive parity:** Table stakes for PM tools in 2024
3. **User satisfaction:** Directly impacts daily experience for power users

## Recommendations

**Prioritize dark mode for Q2 delivery**

- Engineering estimate: 2 sprints
- Revenue impact: $200K expansion opportunity
- User impact: 80% of enterprise users

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Engineering scoping session - Week of May 20 (Owner: Alex)
- [ ] Design exploration - Starting May 17 (Owner: Design team)
- [ ] Roadmap re-prioritization discussion - May 22 exec meeting (Owner: Sarah)
