# Module 1.5: Planning Mode - Teaching Script

Welcome to Module 1.5: Planning Mode

In Module 1.2 you learned about Fast mode vs Planning mode

Now we're going to experience Planning mode in action - it's a game-changer for complex PM work

**STOP: Ready to see the power of Planning mode?**

**USER: Confirms**

---

Quick recap from Module 1.2:

**Fast Mode** = Quick back-and-forth (what you've been using). Great for simple tasks, questions, quick edits. Agent responds directly to your requests.

**Planning Mode** = Agent plans before acting. Creates a detailed task breakdown BEFORE executing. Shows you exactly what it will do. Perfect for complex, multi-step work.

The magic of Planning mode is **upfront clarification** - the agent asks all the right questions and creates a plan BEFORE doing any work. This is the new gold standard for working with LLMs!

**STOP: Make sense so far?**

**USER: Confirms**

Let's try Planning mode with a realistic PM scenario

You're planning a feature launch for TaskFlow's new real-time collaboration feature

This needs: messaging strategy, email sequences, in-app announcements, and success metrics

That's complex enough that Planning mode will really shine

**Before we start, make two changes:**
- **Switch to Gemini 3 Pro (High)** - Planning mode works best with more powerful models. Look for the model selector and change it.
- **Switch to Planning Mode** - Look for the mode toggle near the chat input and switch from Fast to Planning.

**STOP: Have you made both changes? (Gemini 3 Pro High selected AND Planning mode enabled)**

**USER: Confirms both changes made**

---

**IMPORTANT: Before proceeding, verify the student has made BOTH changes: (1) Gemini 3 Pro (High) model selected, and (2) Planning mode enabled. If they're not sure, have them check both settings before continuing.**

---

Let me show you the feature we're launching

**ACTION: Read lesson-modules/1.5-autonomy-modes/feature-announcement.md and present the details**

This is TaskFlow's new real-time collaboration feature - a significant launch that needs proper planning!

**STOP: Sound like a realistic PM task?**

**USER: Confirms**

---

Now let's see Planning mode in action

With Planning mode enabled, ask me to plan the launch campaign. The agent will create a structured task breakdown before doing anything.

**STOP: Type this: "Plan a multi-channel launch campaign for this feature. Research our positioning and target customers, then create a go-to-market plan with messaging strategy, email sequences, and success metrics."**

**USER: Types the prompt**

---

**ACTION: When in Planning mode, the agent should:**
1. Create a Task file with structured breakdown showing:
   - Initial discovery and research
   - Stakeholder clarification (ask questions)
   - Create implementation plan
   - Execute plan (create deliverables)
   - Final verification
2. Ask clarifying questions before executing
3. Show the plan to the user

---

See what just happened?

Look in the **Files Edited** section in the sidebar - you should see a **Task file** that was created

This is the agent's plan! Open it and take a look.

The Task file breaks down the work into clear steps: Initial discovery and research, Clarifying questions to ask you, Implementation plan, Execution steps, Verification.

This upfront planning is incredibly valuable - you can see exactly what the agent will do before it starts!

**STOP: Can you see the Task file? Open it and tell me what steps you see.**

**USER: Describes the task breakdown they see**

---

This is why Planning mode is so powerful for complex PM work:

**Transparency** - You see the plan BEFORE work begins. **Clarification** - The agent asks questions to understand your needs. **Control** - You can adjust the plan before execution. **Quality** - More thinking upfront = better results.

Now the agent will ask you some clarifying questions to make the plan specific to YOUR needs.

---

**ACTION: Ask clarifying questions like:**
- Which customer segment should we prioritize - Enterprise teams (Sarah persona) or smaller teams (Mike/Alex personas)?
- What's your timeline - quick 2-week launch or more extended 4-week rollout?
- Should we lead with email campaign, in-app announcement, or coordinated simultaneous launch?

**STOP: Answer the clarifying questions. (You can give whatever answers you want - this is YOUR launch strategy!)**

**USER: Answers the questions**

---

Great choices!

Here's the cool part: When you answer these questions, the agent incorporates your decisions into the plan. It's not just executing blindly - it's adapting to YOUR strategic choices.

Now the agent will execute the plan and create your deliverables.

**STOP: Let the agent execute the plan. It will create your launch campaign documents. Say "Go ahead" or "Execute the plan"**

**USER: Gives permission to execute**

---

**ACTION: Create the planned deliverables:**
- lesson-modules/1.5-autonomy-modes/launch-campaign-plan.md
- lesson-modules/1.5-autonomy-modes/launch-timeline.md

Structure the files based on the user's answers to the clarifying questions.

---

Done! All deliverables created as outlined in the plan

**STOP: Do you see the new files in the file explorer? Open them and check if they match your strategic choices.**

**USER: Confirms**

---

This is the power of Planning Mode

The complete workflow was: You gave one complex prompt, Agent created a Task file with structured breakdown, Agent asked clarifying questions, You made strategic decisions, Agent executed based on YOUR choices, Deliverables created that match YOUR vision.

This "plan first, ask questions, then execute" approach is perfect for complex PM work

You stay in control while the agent handles the complexity

**STOP: Can you see how this is different from Fast mode?**

**USER: Confirms**

Now let's try something really cool - **image generation**!

Antigravity can generate images using Nano Banana Pro - Google's image generation model

For a product launch, you often need visuals: mockups, announcement graphics, presentation images

Good news: you're already on **Gemini 3 Pro (High)** from when we enabled Planning mode - that's the model required for image generation!

**STOP: Ready to generate a visual?**

**USER: Confirms**

---

Now let's generate a visual mockup of the collaboration feature for your launch deck

This is perfect for stakeholder presentations or marketing materials

**STOP: Type this: "Generate a UI mockup showing TaskFlow's real-time collaboration feature with live cursors and teammate presence indicators. Make it look like a clean, modern project management interface."**

**USER: Types the prompt**

---

**ACTION: Generate a UI mockup image using Nano Banana Pro showing:**
- TaskFlow-style interface with a task board or project view
- 2-3 colored cursors with teammate names (like "Sarah", "Mike")
- Presence indicators showing who's online
- Clean, modern design aesthetic
- Save as launch-feature-mockup.png

---

Look at that! You just generated a visual mockup without needing a designer!

**STOP: Do you see the generated image? Could you use something like this in a launch deck or PRD?**

**USER: Confirms**

---

For PMs, image generation is incredibly useful:

**UI mockups** - Visualize features before engineering starts. **PRD illustrations** - Show what you mean, not just describe it. **Launch assets** - Create marketing visuals quickly. **Presentation graphics** - Make your decks more compelling.

You went from "plan a launch" to having documents AND visuals in one session!

**STOP: Any questions about image generation?**

**USER: Responds**

---

Let's recap what you learned:

**Planning Mode:** Creates a Task file with structured breakdown. Asks clarifying questions before executing. You see the plan BEFORE work begins. Perfect for complex, multi-step PM work.

**Image Generation (Nano Banana Pro):** Requires Gemini 3 Pro (High) model (which you already have enabled). Generate UI mockups, graphics, visualizations. Great for PRDs, presentations, launch materials.

**When to use which mode:** **Fast Mode** - Simple tasks, questions, quick edits. **Planning Mode** - Complex deliverables, multi-step projects, anything where you want to see the plan first.

**STOP: Make sense?**

**USER: Confirms**

Before we move on, **switch back to Fast mode** for the next module

Planning mode is powerful but adds overhead - for Module 1.6 we'll use Fast mode

**STOP: Have you switched back to Fast mode?**

**USER: Confirms**
