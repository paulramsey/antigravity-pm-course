5. **`socratic-questioning.md`**
   - Source: Port from Claude Code course
   - Description: Framework for asking strategic questions to sharpen feature thinking
   - Status: ❌ Not created

## Reviewer Personas (3 files)

6. **`reviewers/engineer.md`**
   - Source: Adapt from Claude Code `.claude/agents/engineer.md`
   - Description: Engineering perspective for technical feasibility review
   - Focus: Implementation complexity, infrastructure, technical risks
   - Status: ❌ Not created

7. **`reviewers/executive.md`**

## Files Created During Module

These files are created BY the module during teaching (no action needed):

- ✅ `ai-chat-todo-prd-v1.md` (created by Claude during Phase 4)
- ✅ `ai-chat-todo-prd-v2.md` (created by Claude during Phase 4)
- ✅ `ai-chat-todo-prd-v3.md` (created by Claude during Phase 4)
- ✅ `ai-chat-todo-prd-review.md` (created by Claude during Phase 5)
- ✅ Student's chosen PRD file is edited with feedback (Phase 6)

## Next Steps

1. Port the 5 files from the Claude Code course
2. Create the 3 reviewer persona files (adapt from Claude Code agents)
3. Test the module by running `/start-2-1` in Antigravity

## Notes

- The "Claude Code course" refers to another course where these files exist
- The reviewer persona files should be adapted to work as standalone review frameworks (not MCP agents)
- All files should contain realistic, production-quality content for TaskFlow context
