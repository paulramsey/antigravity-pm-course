# Module 2.1: Write a PRD - Teaching Script

## Introduction & Overview

Welcome to Module 2.1: Write a PRD!

This module teaches you how to partner with AI to write better Product Requirements Documents faster.

The key insight: AI isn't here to ghostwrite your PRD - it's here to help you think more clearly and move faster.

You'll drive every decision, I'll help you explore options and refine your thinking.

## Show Complete Workflow

Let me show you the complete workflow we'll follow today.

Here's what each phase does:
- Phase 1: Choose Foundation (select your PRD template)
- Phase 2: Build Context (company background + user research)
- Phase 3: Sharpen Thinking (Socratic questioning to refine your idea)
- Phase 4: Generate Options (create 3 different PRD versions)
- Phase 5: Multi-Perspective Review (get feedback from 3 reviewer personas)
- Phase 6: Address Feedback (make strategic decisions and implement changes)
- Result: Completed PRD ready to share with stakeholders

This gives you a complete map of where we're going.

**STOP: Any questions before we begin?**

**USER: Confirms**

## File Orientation

Perfect! Now let me walk you through the files we'll be using today.

**ACTION: List files in lesson-modules/2.1-write-prd/ folder structure**

Here's what each file does:
- prd-templates/: Two professional templates you can choose from (Carl's detailed version, Lenny's 7-question version)
- taskflow-company-context.md: Everything about the company (product, customers, strategy)
- user-research/pain-points.md: Real user research insights to ground your PRD
- socratic-questioning.md: Framework for sharpening your feature thinking
- reviewers/: Three different personas who'll review your PRD (engineer, executive, user researcher)

**STOP: Take a minute to look at the folder structure - do you see all these files?**

**USER: Confirms**

---

## Phase 1: Choose Your Foundation

Great! Let's start Phase 1: Choose Your Foundation.

You need a PRD template to work from.

I have two professional templates you can use, or you can bring your own.

**ACTION: Read both prd-templates/Carls-PRD-Template.md and prd-templates/Lennys-PRD-Template.md**

Here are your options:
- Carl's PRD Template: Comprehensive structure with Problem Alignment, Solution Alignment, and Development Planning - great for complex features needing stakeholder buy-in
- Lenny's PRD Template: Minimal 7 questions (What, Why, Who, Success, etc.) - perfect for moving fast on smaller features
- Your Own Template: For real PM work, you'd use whatever template your company prefers - these are just examples

**STOP: Which would you like to use for today's exercise? Say: "Carl's template", "Lenny's template", or "I'll use my own"**

**USER: Chooses template**

---

## Introduce the Feature

Excellent choice!

For today's practice, we'll build a PRD for this feature: An AI voice chat interface for managing your to-do list.

Think of it like talking to an assistant who helps you organize tasks.

Now let's move to Phase 2: Build Context.

Great PRDs are grounded in company strategy and user research.

Before we write anything, I need context on TaskFlow and what users are asking for.

**STOP: Now say: "Review taskflow-company-context.md and pain-points.md before we begin"**

**USER: Review taskflow-company-context.md and pain-points.md before we begin**

---

## Phase 2: Build Context

**ACTION: Read taskflow-company-context.md and user-research/pain-points.md**

Perfect! I've read both files and now have full context on:
- TaskFlow's product (project management for remote teams, 10K users, $2.5M ARR)
- Your target customers (SMBs with 5-20 person teams)
- Key pain points from user research (complexity overwhelm, need for quick task capture)

This context will make the PRD much stronger.

**STOP: Make sense so far?**

**USER: Confirms**

---

## Phase 3: Sharpen Your Thinking

Now for Phase 3: Sharpen Your Thinking.

Before we write anything, let's refine the feature idea through strategic questions.

This is where AI partnership really shines - I can help you think more rigorously.

I'm going to use the Socratic questioning framework from socratic-questioning.md.

I'll ask you 3 strategic questions about your AI voice chat feature.

For this demo, I'll give you multiple-choice options to keep things moving.

In real PM work, the AI could ask more open-ended questions and you'd type out your thinking.

But multiple choice makes this teaching module faster and easier.

**STOP: Now say: "Use the Socratic questioning framework to sharpen my thinking on this feature"**

**USER: Use the Socratic questioning framework to sharpen my thinking on this feature**

---

## Socratic Question 1

**ACTION: Read socratic-questioning.md**

Great! I've loaded the framework - let's dive into the questions.

Question 1: What's the core job-to-be-done that voice chat solves for TaskFlow users?

**STOP: What's your thinking?**
- A) Hands-free task capture while multitasking (meeting, driving, cooking)
- B) Faster than typing for quick tasks
- C) More natural/conversational interface feels less intimidating
- D) Accessibility for users who struggle with typing

**USER: Chooses A, B, C, or D**

---

## Socratic Question 2

Great insight! That's a solid foundation for the feature.

Question 2: How does this fit TaskFlow's strategic focus on remote teams?

**STOP: Your thoughts?**
- A) Remote workers are often in meetings where typing is disruptive but voice notes work
- B) Distributed teams need async communication - voice memos are async
- C) Remote workers multitask more (kids, errands) - need hands-free tools
- D) Doesn't really fit - this is just a cool feature

**USER: Chooses A, B, C, or D**

---

## Socratic Question 3

Exactly! You're seeing the strategic connection to TaskFlow's positioning.

Question 3: What's the main risk or concern with adding voice chat to a productivity tool?

**STOP: What worries you?**
- A) Privacy/security - users won't want voice data stored
- B) Accuracy - voice recognition errors could frustrate users
- C) Context mismatch - many users work in open offices or quiet spaces where they can't talk
- D) Complexity - adds cognitive load to learn a new interaction mode

**USER: Chooses A, B, C, or D**

---

## Transition to Phase 4

That's an important consideration to address in the PRD!

Excellent thinking! Your feature idea is getting sharper.

I can see this taking shape: Voice chat for quick task capture, especially valuable for remote workers who need hands-free interaction.

Now we're ready for Phase 4: Generate Options.

Here's a pro tip: AI is non-deterministic - the same inputs can produce different outputs.

Different language, different emphasis, different structure - even with identical starting conditions.

Let's generate 3 draft PRDs using identical inputs (your template + context + research + answers).

This gives you options to compare - pick whichever framing resonates most, or cherry-pick the best parts from each.

**STOP: Now say: "Generate 3 draft PRDs"**

**USER: Generate 3 draft PRDs**

---

## Phase 4: Generate Three PRD Versions

**ACTION: Create ai-chat-todo-prd-v1.md**
- Use chosen template structure
- Incorporate company context, user research, and Socratic question answers

**ACTION: Create ai-chat-todo-prd-v2.md**
- Same inputs as v1 (template + context + research + answers)
- AI will naturally produce variations in language and emphasis

**ACTION: Create ai-chat-todo-prd-v3.md**
- Same inputs as v1 and v2
- Another variation to compare

Done! I've created 3 draft PRDs using identical inputs.

Each one might emphasize different aspects, use different language, or structure arguments differently.

That's the nature of AI - non-deterministic outputs from the same inputs.

**STOP: Review all 3 versions - which one resonates most? Say "v1", "v2", "v3", or "I want to combine elements from multiple versions"**

**USER: Chooses version or combines**

---

## Phase 5: Multi-Perspective Review

Good eye! You picked the version that works best.

Now let's get this PRD stress-tested from multiple perspectives.

Now for Phase 5: Multi-Perspective Review.

Before anyone sees your PRD, let's get feedback from three different perspectives.

I have three reviewer personas in the reviewers/ folder: engineer (technical feasibility), executive (business value), user researcher (UX/needs).

In real PM work, you could create your own reviewer personas - maybe a designer, data scientist, support lead - whatever perspectives matter for your product.

These are reusable files you can refine over time, just like we talked about with templates and workflows earlier.

I'll review your PRD from all three perspectives and consolidate the feedback into one document.

**STOP: Now ask me for a review from all the reviwers, say: "Review this PRD from all three perspectives in @reviewers/ and consolidate the feedback into a new doc"**

**USER: Review this PRD from all three perspectives in @reviewers/ and consolidate the feedback into a new doc**

---

## Execute Multi-Perspective Review

**ACTION: Read all files in reviewers/ folder (engineer.md, executive.md, user-researcher.md)**

**ACTION: Read the chosen PRD version**

**ACTION: Create ai-chat-todo-prd-review.md consolidating feedback from all three perspectives**
- Engineering Perspective: Technical feasibility, implementation complexity, infrastructure needs, potential issues, recommendations
- Executive Perspective: Business value, strategic fit, market differentiation, resource commitment, ROI concerns, recommendations
- User Research Perspective: User needs validation, usability concerns, accessibility, adoption risks, recommendations
- Common Themes: Identify patterns across all three perspectives
- Priority Feedback Items: Rank by importance

Done! I've reviewed your PRD from all three perspectives and created a comprehensive consolidated review in ai-chat-todo-prd-review.md.

**STOP: Take a look at the review document, then say: "Help me address the feedback here"**

**USER: Views document, then says: Help me address the feedback here**

---

## Phase 6: Address Feedback - Item 1

Perfect! Phase 6: Address the Feedback.

Let's work through the major feedback items and improve your PRD.

I'll present each key piece of feedback as a multiple-choice question - you choose the approach, I implement it.

Looking at the engineering feedback: "Start with text-based version first, add voice in v2 - reduces risk"

**STOP: How should we address this?**
- A) Agree - phase the rollout with text first
- B) Disagree - ship voice from day 1 since it's the core value prop
- C) Hybrid - build both but make voice optional beta feature

**USER: Chooses A, B, or C**

---

## Address Feedback - Item 2

Smart choice! That balances risk with impact.

Next feedback from executive: "Add monetization angle - could this be a premium feature?"

**STOP: How should we address this?**
- A) Yes - make it Premium/Max tier only
- B) No - free feature to drive engagement
- C) Freemium - basic voice free, advanced features (transcripts, voice commands) premium

**USER: Chooses A, B, or C**

---

## Address Feedback - Item 3

Good thinking on the monetization strategy!

Final feedback from UX research: "Strong onboarding flow needed - users might not understand how to use voice"

**STOP: How should we address this?**
- A) Guided tutorial on first use with voice prompts
- B) Subtle hints/tooltips that appear contextually
- C) Video demo in product tour

**USER: Chooses A, B, or C**

---

## Implement Feedback Changes

Excellent! That onboarding approach should help with adoption.

Perfect! You've made strategic decisions on all the major feedback.

Now let me implement these changes directly in your PRD.

**ACTION: Edit the chosen PRD version (v1, v2, or v3) to incorporate feedback decisions**
- Update phasing approach based on engineering feedback choice
- Add monetization section based on executive feedback choice
- Add onboarding/UX section based on UX feedback choice
- Refine success metrics to reflect new approach
- Update timeline if needed

Done! I've updated your PRD with all the feedback responses.

You should see the changes highlighted in the file - this is how you'd actually iterate on a PRD in real work.

It now includes the phasing strategy, monetization approach, and UX onboarding plan you decided on.

**STOP: Review the updated PRD file - do you see all the changes incorporated?**

**USER: Confirms**

## Recap Accomplishments

Excellent work! Let's recap what you just accomplished:
- ✅ Chose a professional PRD template (or brought your own)
- ✅ Grounded your thinking in company context and user research
- ✅ Sharpened your feature idea through Socratic questioning
- ✅ Generated 3 draft PRDs to compare
- ✅ Got multi-perspective feedback (engineering, executive, UX)
- ✅ Made strategic decisions on how to address feedback
- ✅ Created a production-ready PRD incorporating all insights

Here's the key insight: YOU drove this entire process.

I didn't ghostwrite a PRD for you.

**STOP: Do you see how you made all the strategic decisions while I helped you think through options?**

**USER: Confirms understanding**

## Key Insights & Customization

This is what AI partnership looks like for PMs:
- AI helps you think more clearly (Socratic questions)
- AI helps you explore options (multiple drafts)
- AI helps you stress-test ideas (multi-perspective review)
- But YOU make all the decisions

Now here's the best part: This workflow is YOURS to customize.

You can modify any step, add new steps, or remove steps that don't work for you.

Want to add a fourth reviewer perspective? Create a designer.md file in the reviewers folder.

Don't like Socratic questions? Skip that phase or replace it with a different framework.

Want to use examples? Add a prd-examples/ folder with great PRDs from PMs at your company and @ mention them.

Prefer different templates? Swap them out.

This is just ONE way to approach PRD writing - you'll build YOUR workflow over time.

The templates, context files, reviewer personas, and frameworks are all living documents you refine as you learn what works.

Congratulations - you now know how to partner with AI to write better PRDs faster!

Next up: Module 2.2 is all about data analysis.

You'll learn how to analyze funnels, build ROI models, and run experiment analysis - the complete data-driven PM workflow.

It's incredibly practical and you'll create real analysis documents you could present to leadership.
