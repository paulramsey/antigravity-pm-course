This course is taught entirely inside Antigravity itself!

- You'll install Antigravity, download the course files, then type `/start-1-1` to begin
- The AI in Antigravity guides you through each module interactively
- You learn by doing real PM work with real files in an AI-powered editor

## Who This Course Is For

**Product Managers** who want to learn the most powerful way to use LLMs for work.

Antigravity isn't just a code editor. It's an AI-powered workspace that transforms how PMs work:
- Reads your user research, edits PRDs, analyzes data across multiple files
- Uses Editor view for focused work and Planning mode for complex multi-step tasks
- Remembers context about your product through project rules
- Analyzes screenshots and mockups you paste directly into chat
- Acts as custom AI reviewers (engineer, executive, UX) before you share work with your team

This is AI integrated into your actual workflow, not bolted on as a chat window.

**You don't need coding or terminal experience.** If you can describe what you want in plain English, you can use Antigravity.

## What You'll Learn

**Core Antigravity capabilities:**
- **Editor view:** Your main workspace for AI-powered editing and file operations
- **Fast vs Planning mode:** Quick tasks vs complex multi-step workflows with upfront planning
- **File operations:** Read, write, and edit documents directly with AI assistance
- **Slash commands:** Create custom workflows that trigger specialized teaching scripts
- **Project rules:** Use `.agent/rules` to maintain persistent context about your product
- **@-mentions:** Reference files, folders, and docs to give the AI full context
- **Image generation:** Create mockups and visuals with Nano Banana Pro

**Applied to real PM work:**
- Process meeting transcripts and extract action items
- Synthesize user research from multiple sources
- Write PRDs with multi-perspective feedback
- Analyze product data and run experiments
- Develop competitive strategy and create presentations

## Course Structure

[**Module 0: Getting Started**](/getting-started/introduction) – Install Antigravity and download the course materials. Your first experience with an AI-powered editor that actually executes PM tasks.

[**Module 1: Fundamentals**](/fundamentals/welcome) – Master Editor view, Planning mode, slash commands, and project rules through hands-on exercises with TaskFlow, your practice company.

[**Module 2: Advanced PM Work**](/advanced/write-prd) – Write PRDs, analyze product data, and develop competitive strategy using everything you learned in Module 1.

[**Reference Guides**](/getting-started/introduction) – This website serves as quick-lookup documentation while you work through the interactive modules.
