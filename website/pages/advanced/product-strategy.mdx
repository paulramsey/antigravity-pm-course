# Module 2.3: Product Strategy
## Reference Guide

- **Time to Complete:** 45-60 minutes
- **Prerequisites:** Modules 2.1 (Write a PRD) and 2.2 (Analyze Data)

> **Start this module in Antigravity:** Run `/start-2-3` to begin the interactive lesson.

## Overview

Use Antigravity to accelerate strategy development from weeks to hours. Research competitors, challenge strategic choices with devil's advocate prompts, synthesize frameworks, and create executive slide decks.

**Key takeaway:** Antigravity handles the mechanics (research, synthesis, formatting) while you make all strategic decisions.

## Strategy Development Workflow

The five-phase approach to building rigorous product strategy with Antigravity:

### 1. Learn Framework

Load a strategic framework into Antigravity's context using @ mentions:

- `@rumelt-strategy-kernel.md` - Diagnosis → Guiding Policy → Coherent Actions
- `@gibson-biddle-dhm.md` - Delight, Hard to Copy, Margin-enhancing (optional)
- `@swot-analysis.md` - Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats (optional)

**Example prompt:** "Explain the three components of @rumelt-strategy-kernel.md"

### 2. Gather Intelligence

Use Antigravity's web search to research competitors:

**Example prompt:** "Search the web for [Competitor A], [Competitor B], and [Competitor C]'s AI features, pricing strategies, and target markets. Then create a competitive landscape comparison table."

Antigravity researches multiple competitors simultaneously and synthesizes findings into structured comparisons.

### 3. Make Strategic Choices

Challenge each strategic decision with devil's advocate prompts:

**Example prompt:** "Help me develop a strategy using @rumelt-strategy-kernel.md and challenge my choices using @devils-advocate-strategy.md"

After you make a choice, Antigravity argues the opposite position to stress-test your thinking. You can stick with your choice or reconsider.

### 4. Synthesize Strategy

Transform choices into a coherent strategy document:

**Example prompt:** "Using @rumelt-strategy-kernel.md, create [filename].md organizing my strategic choices into Diagnosis, Guiding Policy, and Coherent Actions"

Antigravity creates a properly structured strategy document following the framework.

### 5. Create Presentation

Generate executive-ready slides with consulting-quality action titles:

**Example prompt:** "Using @presentation-best-practices.md and @[strategy-doc].md, create [slides-filename].md with 12-15 slides using action titles"

Antigravity creates slide content (markdown format) you can copy into PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Keynote.

## Strategy Synthesis Techniques

| Technique | Use Case | Example Prompt |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Competitive Research** | Understanding market landscape | "Research [competitors] and create comparison table covering features, pricing, and positioning" |
| **Devil's Advocate** | Challenge strategic choices | "Challenge my decision to [choice] using @devils-advocate-strategy.md" |
| **Framework Application** | Structure strategic thinking | "Apply @rumelt-strategy-kernel.md to organize my choices" |
| **Coherence Visualization** | Show how choices reinforce each other | "Create a Mermaid diagram showing how my 5 strategic choices connect" |
| **Action Titles** | Executive slide writing | "Convert 'Market Analysis' to an action title that conveys the insight" |

## Working with Multiple Research Documents

### @ Mention Multiple Frameworks

Antigravity can apply multiple frameworks simultaneously:

```
"Using @rumelt-strategy-kernel.md and @swot-analysis.md,
create a strategy that addresses our strengths and the
competitive opportunity"
```

### Reference Competitive Research

After gathering intelligence, reference findings in strategy synthesis:

```
"Based on the competitive landscape research, what's our
best differentiation opportunity for SMB teams?"
```

### Connect Strategy to PRD

Link strategic documents to feature specifications:

```
"Using @h1-2026-ai-product-strategy.md, create a PRD for
the Q1 voice features initiative"
```

## Creating Roadmaps and Strategic Documents

### Strategy Document Structure

A strong strategy document (following Rumelt's Kernel):

1. **Diagnosis** - The critical challenge/opportunity based on data and competitive landscape
2. **Guiding Policy** - Your overall approach (synthesis of strategic choices)
3. **Coherent Actions** - Concrete initiatives, roadmap, resource allocation
4. **Critical Assumptions** - What must be true for this to work

### Executive Slide Deck Structure

Consulting-quality presentation flow (12-15 slides):

1. Title
2. Executive Summary (action title)
3. Diagnosis (competitive landscape)
4. Strategic Direction (your choices)
5. Tradeoffs Made
6. H1/H2 Roadmap (by quarter)
7. Success Metrics
8. Critical Assumptions
9. Why We'll Win
10. Risks & Mitigation
11. The Ask

### Action Titles Best Practice

**Bad (topic label):** "Market Analysis"
**Good (action title):** "SMBs Are Underserved by Current AI Tools"

Action titles convey the insight, not just the topic. Antigravity learns this from `@presentation-best-practices.md`.

## Using Antigravity for Competitive Analysis

### Multi-Competitor Research

Antigravity can research multiple competitors in parallel:

```
"Search the web for [A], [B], and [C]. For each, find:
- Core AI features
- Pricing strategy
- Target market segment
- Positioning statement
Then synthesize into a comparison table."
```

### Deep-Dive on Specific Competitor

```
"Research [Competitor X]'s AI strategy. What are they
building, who are they targeting, and what's their
differentiation?"
```

### Identify White Space

```
"Based on the competitive research, what market segments
or use cases are underserved?"
```

## Quick Example: TaskFlow AI Strategy

**Scenario:** You're the Gen AI PM at TaskFlow with 2 engineers and $50k budget for H1 2026. The CEO asks for your AI strategy.

**Phase 1 - Framework:**
```
"Explain @rumelt-strategy-kernel.md"
```

**Phase 2 - Intelligence:**
```
"Search the web for Notion, Linear, and Asana's AI features,
pricing, and target markets. Create comparison table."
```

**Phase 3 - Choices:**
```
"Help me develop strategy using @rumelt-strategy-kernel.md
and challenge choices using @devils-advocate-strategy.md"
```

Make 5 strategic decisions (Focus, Competition, Pricing, Scope, Risk). Antigravity challenges each one.

**Phase 4 - Synthesis:**
```
"Using @rumelt-strategy-kernel.md, create
h1-2026-ai-strategy.md with Diagnosis, Guiding Policy,
and Coherent Actions"
```

**Phase 5 - Presentation:**
```
"Using @presentation-best-practices.md and
@h1-2026-ai-strategy.md, create strategy-slides.md
with action titles"
```

Result: Complete AI product strategy with competitive research, framework-based structure, and executive slide deck in under 60 minutes.

## Troubleshooting

### "Antigravity's competitive research is too generic"
**Fix:** Be specific in your prompts. Instead of "Research competitor X," ask "What AI features has [Competitor X] launched in 2024-2025? How are they pricing it? Who's the target customer?"

### "Devil's advocate challenges feel weak"
**Fix:** Ensure you've @ mentioned `devils-advocate-strategy.md`. Explicitly ask Antigravity to "argue the opposite position as strongly as possible and poke holes in my thinking."

### "Action titles are still just topic labels"
**Fix:** @ mention `presentation-best-practices.md` and ask Antigravity to "convert these slide topics into McKinsey/BCG-style action titles that convey the insight, not just the topic."

### "Strategy document lacks coherence"
**Fix:** After creating the strategy, ask Antigravity: "Create a Mermaid diagram showing how my strategic choices reinforce each other. Identify any contradictions." Visual representation often reveals gaps.
