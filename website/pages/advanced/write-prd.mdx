# Module 2.1: Write a PRD
## Reference Guide

- **Time to Complete:** 45-60 minutes
- **Prerequisites:** Module 1.7 (Agents & Workflows)

> **Start this module in Antigravity:** Run `/start-2-1` to begin the interactive lesson.

## 📖 Overview

Write complete, production-ready PRDs using AI as a thinking partner - not a ghostwriter. You make strategic decisions, AI helps you explore options and stress-test ideas.

**Key takeaway:** Use context files, strategic questioning, and multi-perspective reviews to create better PRDs faster.

## PRD Writing Workflow

### 6-Phase Process

**Phase 1: Choose Foundation**
- Select PRD template (your company's template or use a standard one)
- Two common formats: comprehensive (Carl's) or minimal (Lenny's 7 questions)

**Phase 2: Build Context**
- @ mention company context files (product, strategy, market)
- @ mention user research files (pain points, interviews, surveys)
- Give AI full background before writing

**Phase 3: Sharpen Thinking**
- Use Socratic questioning framework to refine feature idea
- Work through 3-5 strategic questions:
  - What job-to-be-done does this solve?
  - How does it fit company strategy?
  - What are the main risks?
- AI asks, you answer - clarifies your thinking

**Phase 4: Generate Options**
- Create 2-3 draft PRDs using identical inputs
- AI produces different variations (emphasis, language, structure)
- Pick the best version or combine elements

**Phase 5: Multi-Perspective Review**
- @ mention reviewer persona files (engineer, executive, designer, etc.)
- Get feedback from each perspective
- Consolidate into single review document

**Phase 6: Address Feedback**
- Work through major feedback items
- Make strategic decisions on how to address each
- AI implements changes in PRD file

## Using @ Mentions for Context

### Company Context
```
@ mention company-context.md for product background
@ mention competitive-landscape.md for market positioning
@ mention personas.md for user segments
```

### Research Inputs
```
@ mention user-research/pain-points.md
@ mention user-research/interviews/*.md
@ mention analytics/funnel-data.csv
```

### Templates & Frameworks
```
@ mention prd-templates/company-template.md
@ mention socratic-questions.md for strategic thinking
@ mention reviewers/ folder for multi-perspective feedback
```

**Pro tip:** Create reusable files you refine over time. Templates, reviewer personas, and frameworks become better as you iterate.

## PRD Structure

### Comprehensive Format (Carl's Template)

**Problem Alignment**
- Problem statement
- User impact
- Success metrics
- Market context

**Solution Alignment**
- Proposed solution
- User experience
- Design principles
- Alternatives considered

**Development Planning**
- Technical approach
- Timeline & milestones
- Resource needs
- Risks & dependencies

### Minimal Format (Lenny's 7 Questions)

1. **What** are we building?
2. **Why** now?
3. **Who** is it for?
4. **How** does it work?
5. **Success** - What does good look like?
6. **Open questions** - What don't we know?
7. **Timeline** - When will this ship?

**Choose based on:**
- Complex features → comprehensive format
- Small iterations → minimal format
- Company culture → use your team's template

## Quick Example: TaskFlow

**Scenario:** Writing PRD for AI voice chat feature

1. **Build context:** @ mention company-context.md (TaskFlow product info) and pain-points.md (user research)
2. **Sharpen thinking:** Work through Socratic questions about job-to-be-done, strategic fit, and risks
3. **Generate options:** Create 3 PRD versions emphasizing different angles (hands-free capture, remote work fit, accessibility)
4. **Get feedback:** @ mention reviewers/engineer.md, reviewers/executive.md, reviewers/user-researcher.md
5. **Address feedback:** Decide on phasing strategy, monetization approach, onboarding flow
6. **Result:** Production-ready PRD with technical feasibility, business value, and UX validated

**Time saved:** 2-3 hours vs. writing from scratch

## Best Practices

### DO:
- **Make all strategic decisions yourself** - AI explores options, you choose
- **Use multiple perspectives** - Engineer, executive, designer, user researcher
- **Generate multiple drafts** - Compare approaches before committing
- **Ground in research** - @ mention actual user data and company context
- **Iterate based on feedback** - Treat AI reviewers like real stakeholders

### DON'T:
- **Don't let AI ghostwrite** - You're the PM, you drive decisions
- **Don't skip context** - AI needs background to write good PRDs
- **Don't accept first draft** - Generate options and compare
- **Don't ignore reviewer feedback** - Work through each major point
- **Don't forget to customize** - Adapt workflow to your company's needs

### Reusable Assets:
- **Templates** - Save your best PRD structures
- **Reviewer personas** - Create files for common stakeholder perspectives
- **Socratic questions** - Develop frameworks for different feature types
- **Context files** - Maintain updated company/product/market background

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "AI PRD is too generic"
**Fix:** @ mention specific context files (company strategy, user research, competitive analysis). Generic inputs = generic outputs.

### "Feedback doesn't match my stakeholders"
**Fix:** Customize reviewer persona files. Add actual quotes/concerns from your real stakeholders to make feedback more realistic.

### "Generated options are too similar"
**Fix:** Run generation multiple times or explicitly request different strategic approaches (e.g., "create one version emphasizing speed, one emphasizing quality, one balancing both").

### "PRD missing key sections"
**Fix:** Check your template file has all required sections. @ mention the template file when generating to ensure AI follows structure.
