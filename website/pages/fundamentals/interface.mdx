# Module 1.2: Using Antigravity's Interface
## Reference Guide

- **Time to Complete:** 20-25 minutes
- **Prerequisites:** Antigravity installed (Module 0.1)

> **Start this module in Antigravity:** Run `/start-1-2` to begin the interactive lesson.

## Overview

Antigravity provides an AI-powered **Editor view** as your main interface for working with files. Within the editor, you can switch between **Fast mode** (quick back-and-forth) and **Planning mode** (complex multi-step tasks with upfront planning). Learn when to use each mode and how to reference files with @ mentions.

**Key takeaway:** Fast mode for quick tasks, Planning mode for complex work requiring coordination across multiple files.

## The Interface Layout

Antigravity's workspace has three main areas:

- **Left:** File explorer (Cmd/Ctrl+B to toggle)
- **Middle:** Editor view (AI-powered editing interface where you work with Gemini)
- **Right:** Context panel (file references, suggestions, and planning)

You can also open a terminal at the bottom with Ctrl+` (backtick).

## Editor View: Fast Mode vs Planning Mode

### Editor View

**What it does:** The main AI-powered interface where you work with Gemini to edit files, write code, and create documentation.

**How it works:**
- Opens in the main editor area
- Shows diffs before applying changes
- Can work with single or multiple files
- Switches between Fast and Planning modes based on task complexity

### Fast Mode

**What it does:** Quick back-and-forth conversation for simple, straightforward tasks. Think of it as rapid iteration with immediate feedback.

**When to use:**
- Quick edits to existing content
- Simple questions about code or files
- Fixing typos or rephrasing text
- Single-file changes
- Exploring ideas before committing

**How it works:**
- Immediate responses without upfront planning
- Best for tasks that can be completed in 1-3 steps
- Minimal overhead - just ask and get results
- Can reference files with @ mentions

**Example tasks:**
- "Fix the typo in this paragraph"
- "Explain what this function does"
- "Rephrase this section to be more concise"

### Planning Mode

**What it does:** For complex tasks requiring multi-step coordination. Gemini creates an upfront plan before executing, ensuring all aspects are considered.

**When to use:**
- Writing PRDs, specs, or documentation from scratch
- Creating new features across multiple files
- Complex refactoring or restructuring
- Tasks requiring coordination between related files
- When you need to ensure nothing is missed

**How it works:**
- Gemini first creates a detailed plan
- You review and approve the plan
- Execution follows the approved plan
- Can edit multiple files in sequence
- Best for substantial, coordinated work

**Example tasks:**
- "Create a PRD for a new notifications feature"
- "Refactor the authentication system across all files"
- "Build a complete API specification with examples"

## Quick Comparison Table

| Mode | Speed | Scope | Best For | Planning Step? |
|----------|----------|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Fast mode** | Immediate | Single/simple tasks | Quick edits, questions, exploration | No |
| **Planning mode** | Upfront planning | Complex/multi-file | Creating, refactoring, coordinated work | Yes |

## Referencing Files with @ Mentions

There are three ways to give Gemini context about files:

### 1. @ Mentions (Most Common)

Type `@` in the editor input to bring up context options:

- `@Files` - Reference specific files (e.g., `@PRD.md`)
- `@Folders` - Reference entire folders (e.g., `@company-context`)
- `@Web` - Search the web for context
- `@Code` - Reference code symbols
- `@Git` - Reference Git commits or branches

**Example:** "Tell me about @COMPANY.md"

### 2. Drag Files

Click and drag files from the file explorer directly into the editor input box. Creates the same file reference as @ mentions.

**When to use:** When you're already browsing files and prefer a visual approach.

### 3. "Add to Chat" (Specific Text)

Highlight text in the editor, then click "Add to Chat" button that appears. Use this for quoting specific sections, not entire files.

**When to use:** Referencing user feedback quotes, specific excerpts, or particular paragraphs.

## Markdown Preview & Editing

**Preview Mode:** Press Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+V to toggle between raw Markdown and formatted preview.

**WYSIWYG Editor (Optional):**
1. Press Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P → "Extensions: Install Extensions"
2. Search for "Markdown Editor" by zaaack
3. Install it
4. Use Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Alt/Opt+M to edit Markdown like Google Docs

**Note:** WYSIWYG editor is optional - preview mode works fine for most PM work.

## AI Model Selector

Located at the bottom of the Editor view. Click the dropdown to switch between Gemini models.

**Recommendation:** Use Gemini 3 Pro (High) for PM work. It's the best balance of quality and speed. Since Antigravity is free, you'll rarely hit any limits doing PRDs and documentation.

## Mode Selection

Antigravity intelligently suggests which mode to use based on your request, but you can manually switch:

- **Fast mode indicator:** Lightning bolt icon
- **Planning mode indicator:** Checklist icon
- **Switch modes:** Click the mode indicator or use the mode selector in the editor

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Mac | Windows |
|--------|-----|---------|
| Open Editor | Cmd+E | Ctrl+E |
| Toggle Fast/Planning | Cmd+Shift+M | Ctrl+Shift+M |
| Toggle File Explorer | Cmd+B | Ctrl+B |
| Markdown Preview | Cmd+Shift+V | Ctrl+Shift+V |
| Command Palette | Cmd+Shift+P | Ctrl+Shift+P |
| Open Terminal | Ctrl+` | Ctrl+` |

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't see the Editor view"
**Fix:** Press Cmd/Ctrl+E to open the AI-powered editor.

### "@ mentions aren't showing up"
**Fix:** Make sure you're typing in the editor input box (not a regular file). Type `@` and wait a moment for the menu to appear.

### "Markdown preview isn't working"
**Fix:** Make sure you have a `.md` file open in the editor, then press Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+V. Only works with Markdown files.

### "How do I know which mode I'm in?"
**Fix:** Look for the mode indicator at the top of the Editor view - lightning bolt for Fast mode, checklist for Planning mode.
