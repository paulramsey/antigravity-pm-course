# Module 1.5: Planning Mode
## Reference Guide

- **Time to Complete:** 25 minutes
- **Prerequisites:** Module 1.4 (Slash Commands)

> **Start this module in Antigravity:** Run `/start-1-5` to begin the interactive lesson.

## 📖 Overview

Antigravity has two AI modes: Fast (quick back-and-forth for simple tasks) and Planning (complex multi-step tasks with upfront planning). Switch between them to match your workflow.

**Key takeaway:** Fast mode executes immediately, Planning mode creates a structured plan first and asks clarifying questions before executing.

## The Two Modes

### Fast Mode (Quick Execution)

**What it does:**
- Reads and writes files immediately
- Runs terminal commands
- Makes changes across multiple files
- Iterates and fixes errors in real-time

**When to use it:**
- 85% of your daily PM work
- Simple, well-defined tasks
- Quick edits and file creation
- When you know exactly what you want

**Example:** "Create a PRD for dark mode feature" - Antigravity writes the file immediately, adds sections, formats it.

This is the **default mode** and what you've been using in all previous modules.

### Planning Mode (Structured Planning)

**What it does:**
- Creates a structured task breakdown before executing
- Asks clarifying questions upfront
- Researches context files automatically
- Shows you the complete plan for review
- Executes only after your approval
- Tracks progress through each planned step

**When to use it:**
- Complex multi-step projects (15% of work)
- Coordinating across teams or channels
- Need stakeholder buy-in before execution
- "Measure twice, cut once" situations
- Unfamiliar territory requiring research

**Workflow:**
1. You give complex request
2. Antigravity creates task breakdown
3. Antigravity asks clarifying questions
4. Antigravity shows complete PLAN for review
5. You review and iterate on plan
6. You approve to execute
7. Antigravity works through plan step-by-step

**Example:** "Plan a multi-channel product launch" - Antigravity asks about priority segments and timeline, creates launch plan with messaging/timeline/metrics, shows you the full plan, waits for approval, then builds all documents step by step.

## Mode Comparison

| Feature | Fast | Planning |
|---------|------|----------|
| **Read files** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Write files** | ✅ Immediately | ✅ After approval |
| **Run commands** | ✅ Immediately | ✅ After approval |
| **Ask clarifying questions** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Create task breakdown** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Show plan before executing** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Research context** | As needed | Upfront |
| **Best for** | Simple tasks | Complex projects |
| **Usage %** | 85% | 15% |

## Switching Modes

Three ways to switch:

1. **Click the mode picker** (lower left of chat box)
2. **Press Cmd/Ctrl + .** (Command/Control + period)
3. **Press Shift + Tab**

Current mode always displays in the chat interface.

## PM Use Cases

### Fast Mode
- "Write a PRD for the onboarding redesign"
- "Process these 10 customer interview transcripts"
- "Create a competitive matrix from these files"
- "Update the roadmap with Q2 priorities"
- "Draft release notes for the new feature"

### Planning Mode
- "Plan a multi-channel product launch campaign"
- "Research competitors and create a complete positioning strategy"
- "Build a go-to-market plan for enterprise customers"
- "Create a customer onboarding program with all documentation"
- "Plan a beta program including recruitment, tracking, and analysis"

**Decision framework:**
- Simple task, clear approach → **Fast Mode**
- Complex project, multiple stakeholders, need structure → **Planning Mode**
- Quick iteration needed → **Fast Mode**
- Want to review approach before execution → **Planning Mode**

## Planning Mode Deep Dive

### How Planning Mode Works

**1. Task Breakdown Creation**

When you give a complex request, Antigravity immediately creates a structured task file showing:
- All steps required
- Dependencies between tasks
- Files to be created
- Expected outcomes

**2. Clarifying Questions**

Antigravity asks about:
- Target audience priorities
- Timeline constraints
- Channel preferences
- Success metrics
- Scope boundaries

**3. Context Research**

Antigravity automatically:
- Reads relevant project files
- Reviews company documentation
- Checks existing templates
- Analyzes similar past work

**4. Plan Review & Iteration**

You can modify the plan before execution:
- "Add webinar to the campaign"
- "Focus on enterprise first"
- "Include social media channels"
- "Remove the email sequence"

**5. Approved Execution**

After you approve, Antigravity:
- Works through each task systematically
- Shows progress on each step
- Handles errors and adjustments
- Delivers complete output

### Typical Planning Mode Session

1. **You:** "Plan a multi-channel launch for real-time collaboration feature targeting enterprise customers."

2. **Antigravity creates task breakdown:**
   ```
   PLAN: Multi-Channel Enterprise Launch

   Tasks:
   1. Research context (PRODUCT.md, PERSONAS.md, competitive docs)
   2. Define launch strategy
   3. Create messaging framework
   4. Build timeline and milestones
   5. Draft channel-specific content
   6. Create metrics dashboard
   ```

3. **Antigravity asks clarifying questions:**
   - "What's your target timeline? (e.g., 2-week beta, 4-week full launch)"
   - "Which enterprise segments are priority? (e.g., Financial Services, Healthcare, Tech)"
   - "Do you want coordinated or phased rollout?"
   - "What channels should we prioritize? (e.g., Email, Sales, In-app, Webinar)"

4. **You answer:**
   "Enterprise first, 2-week beta then 4-week launch, coordinated simultaneous across email and sales"

5. **Antigravity updates and shows PLAN:**
   Shows complete plan with all deliverables, timeline, and approach

6. **You review and refine:**
   "Add sales enablement materials and customer success playbook"

7. **Antigravity updates plan**

8. **You approve:**
   Give approval to execute

9. **Antigravity executes:**
   Creates all documents following the plan, showing progress on each task

### Key Advantages of Planning Mode

**Transparency:** You see the full approach before work begins

**Alignment:** Clarifying questions ensure Antigravity understands requirements

**Control:** Review and adjust the plan before committing resources

**Efficiency:** Structured approach reduces rework and iteration

**Documentation:** The plan itself becomes a project artifact

## When to Choose Each Mode

### Use Fast Mode When:
- You know exactly what you want
- Task is straightforward and well-scoped
- Quick iteration is more important than upfront planning
- Single deliverable with clear requirements
- Time is limited and you need immediate output

### Use Planning Mode When:
- Project has multiple interdependent tasks
- You're not sure of the best approach
- Stakeholder alignment is critical
- Want to review scope before execution
- Coordinating across teams or channels
- Need documentation of the planned approach
- Working in unfamiliar territory

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Can't find mode picker"
**Fix:** Look in the lower left of the chat input box. You'll see "Fast" or "Planning" displayed.

### "Planning mode not asking questions"
**Fix:** Make your request more complex. Planning mode asks questions for multi-step projects, not simple tasks. Try Fast mode for simple requests.

### "Want to switch modes mid-conversation"
**Fix:** Use Cmd/Ctrl + . or click the mode picker. You can switch modes at any time, but work in progress will continue in the original mode.

### "Plan created but can't figure out how to approve"
**Fix:** Look for approval options in the chat after the plan is shown. You can also just say "approved" or "looks good, execute."

### "Planning mode feels too slow for my task"
**Fix:** Switch to Fast mode. Planning mode is designed for complex projects - if it feels like overkill, use Fast mode instead.
