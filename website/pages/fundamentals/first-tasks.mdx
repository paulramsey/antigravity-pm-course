# Module 1.3: First PM Tasks
## Reference Guide

- **Time to Complete:** 15-20 minutes
- **Prerequisites:** Module 1.2 (Antigravity interface, @ mentions)

> **Start this module in Antigravity:** Run `/start-1-3` to begin the interactive lesson.

## 📖 Overview

Learn the three core file operations PMs use daily: editing existing files, creating new formatted files, and analyzing multiple files simultaneously.

**Key takeaway:** Combine @ mentions with clear instructions to read, edit, create, or synthesize PM documents.

## 🎯 The Three Core Operations

### 1. Edit Existing File (Append/Update)

**Use when:** Adding to meeting notes, updating specs, appending summaries

**Pattern:**
```
Read @filename.md and append a summary section to the bottom
```

**What happens:**
1. Antigravity reads the file
2. Proposes changes in Apply/Reject workflow
3. You review and accept changes
4. Original file gets updated

**Example:**
```
Read @meeting-notes-raw.md and append a clean summary section to the bottom of the file
```

### 2. Create New File (Transform)

**Use when:** Converting notes to emails, creating PRDs from meetings, formatting deliverables

**Pattern:**
```
Read @source-file.md and create a new file called output-file.md formatted as [format]
```

**What happens:**
1. Antigravity reads source file
2. Creates new file with transformed content
3. Shows new file in Apply/Reject workflow
4. Original file stays unchanged

**Example:**
```
Read @product-sync-notes.md and create a new file called product-sync-email.md formatted as an executive email summary
```

### 3. Analyze Multiple Files (Synthesize)

**Use when:** Synthesizing user interviews, analyzing meeting notes, combining research

**Pattern:**
```
Analyze all files in @folder-name and create a new file called output.md with [specific analysis]
```

**What happens:**
1. Antigravity reads entire folder contents
2. Synthesizes information across all files
3. Creates new document with insights
4. All source files stay unchanged

**Example:**
```
Analyze all files in @user-interviews and create a new file called user-research-insights.md with the top 3 pain points and supporting quotes
```

## 🔄 Apply/Reject Workflow

Every file operation shows proposed changes before applying them.

### How It Works

1. **Antigravity proposes changes** - Shows diff of what will change
2. **You review** - Check if changes look correct
3. **Accept or reject** - Click "Accept All" or review individually
4. **Changes apply** - File gets updated or created

### When to Use Each Option

| Action | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Accept All** | Most PM tasks - clean summaries, formatted outputs |
| **Review Individual** | Editing sensitive content, changing specs with approvals |
| **Reject** | Output doesn't match requirements, needs refinement |

## 📋 Quick Reference: PM Use Cases

| Task | Operation | Example Command |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| Clean up meeting notes | Edit existing | "Append summary to @notes.md" |
| Create exec summary email | Create new | "Read @notes.md and create executive-email.md" |
| Synthesize user research | Analyze folder | "Analyze @interviews and create insights.md" |
| Update PRD with decisions | Edit existing | "Read @decisions.md and update @prd.md with new requirements" |
| Format research findings | Create new | "Read @raw-research.md and create polished-research-report.md" |
| Combine multiple sources | Analyze folder | "Analyze @competitive-research and create comparison-matrix.md" |

## 🎯 TaskFlow Examples

### Scenario 1: Clean Meeting Notes
You took rough notes in `product-strategy-meeting.md` during a call. Add a polished summary:

```
Read @product-strategy-meeting.md and append a clean summary section with key decisions and action items
```

### Scenario 2: Create Executive Update
Transform your weekly team sync notes into an email for your VP:

```
Read @weekly-sync-notes.md and create vp-update-email.md formatted as an executive summary email
```

## 💡 Best Practices

### Be Specific with Instructions

**❌ Vague:**
```
Make this better
```

**✅ Specific:**
```
Read @notes.md and create summary.md with 3 key takeaways and action items
```

### Use @ Mentions for Context

**❌ No context:**
```
Create a PRD
```

**✅ With context:**
```
Read @meeting-notes.md and @user-research.md and create feature-prd.md
```

### Choose the Right Operation

- **Append to existing** - When you want to keep context/history
- **Create new file** - When you need different format or audience
- **Analyze folder** - When patterns span multiple documents

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Antigravity created a file but I don't see it"
**Fix:** Check the file explorer - new files appear where you specified. Use full path like `lesson-modules/1.3-first-tasks/newfile.md` if needed.

### "Changes aren't applying when I click Accept"
**Fix:** Make sure you clicked "Accept All" or accepted each individual change. Check the file in editor to confirm changes applied.

### "Antigravity edited the wrong file"
**Fix:** Be specific with @ mentions. Use `@folder/filename.md` if multiple files have similar names.

### "Folder analysis only read some files"
**Fix:** Ensure all files are saved. Try mentioning the folder directly: `@folder-name/` (with trailing slash).
