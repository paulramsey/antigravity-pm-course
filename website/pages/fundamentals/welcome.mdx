- 15-30 minutes per module

### Reference Guides

- Use for quick lookups after completing modules
- Includes troubleshooting and resources

### Three Levels

**Level 0: Setup** (2 modules)
- Installing Antigravity
- Opening course folder

**Level 1: Antigravity Fundamentals** (7 modules)
- Interface, @ mentions, editor view
- File operations and workflows
- Custom commands, project rules

**Level 2: Real PM Work** (3+ modules)
- Writing PRDs
- Analyzing user research
- Data analysis and synthesis

## ⏱️ Time Commitment

**Per module:** 15-30 minutes
**Full course:** 15-20 hours (self-paced)

**You can:**
- Take breaks anytime
- Do one module per day
- Binge entire sections
- Skip around (though sequential is recommended)

## 📂 File Structure

When you open the course folder in Antigravity, you'll see:

```
company-context/
├── COMPANY.md          # Company overview
├── PRODUCT.md          # Product details
├── PERSONAS.md         # User personas
└── COMPETITIVE.md      # Competitive landscape

lesson-modules/
├── 1.1-welcome/        # This module
├── 1.2-interface/      # Next module
└── [more modules...]   # As you progress

.antigravity/
├── rules/              # Project context
└── commands/           # Slash commands (/start-X-X)
```

**Pro tip:** Keep company context files open in tabs for quick reference during exercises.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the course files in Antigravity"
**Fix:** Press Cmd+Shift+E (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+E (Windows) to open file explorer. Make sure you opened the course folder, not just Antigravity.

### "Slash commands aren't working"
**Fix:** Type slash commands in the editor view. Start with `/start-1-1` exactly as shown.

### "I'm confused about TaskFlow vs real work"
**Fix:** TaskFlow is fictional practice context. After the course, you'll use these same Antigravity skills with your real company's documents.
