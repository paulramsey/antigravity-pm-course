# Module 1.6: Project Rules & Context
## Reference Guide

- **Time to Complete:** 15-20 minutes
- **Prerequisites:** Module 1.5 (Ask, Agent, Plan modes)

> **Start this module in Antigravity:** Run `/start-1-6` to begin the interactive lesson.

## 📖 Overview

Create `.agent/rules` files that auto-apply context to every conversation. Set your product terminology, personas, and writing preferences once instead of repeating them in every chat.

**Key takeaway:** Project rules give Antigravity persistent memory about your product without needing @ mentions each time.

## 🎯 What Are Project Rules?

Project rules are markdown files in `.agent/rules/` that Antigravity automatically loads into every chat session in that project.

### How They Work

1. **Create** `.agent/rules/yourfile.mdc` in your project
2. **Add** context (terminology, personas, style guides)
3. **Antigravity auto-loads** this context in every conversation
4. **No @ mention needed** - it just knows

### Project vs Global Rules

| Type | Location | Applies To |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Project Rules** | `.agent/rules/` folder in project | This project only |
| **Global Rules** | Antigravity Settings → Rules | Every project you open |

**Use project rules for:** Company/product-specific context (TaskFlow terminology, personas)
**Use global rules for:** Personal preferences across all work (PRD format, writing style)

## 🔧 Creating a Rules File

### Quick Steps

1. **Create the folder:** `.agent/rules/` in your project root
2. **Create a file:** `.agent/rules/yourname.mdc` (use `.mdc` extension)
3. **Add context:** Write in markdown format
4. **Save** - Antigravity auto-loads it immediately

### Example Rules Structure

```markdown
# Product Terminology

Use these terms consistently:
- "Workspace" (not "Project")
- "Task" (not "To-do" or "Item")
- "Member" (not "User" or "Person")

# User Personas

- **Sarah Chen** - Enterprise Admin at Acme Corp
- **Mike Rodriguez** - IC Engineer on Product team
- **Alex Kim** - Engineering Team Lead

# Writing Style

- Active voice
- Oxford commas
- No emojis in product docs
- Conversational but professional tone

# Output Preferences

- Always use persona names in examples (Sarah, Mike, Alex)
- Include specific use cases, not abstract concepts
- Format lists with markdown bullets
```

## 📝 What to Include in Rules

### 1. Product Terminology

Define your product's vocabulary to avoid inconsistent naming:

```markdown
# TaskFlow Terminology

**Features:**
- Workspace (not Project, Folder, or Space)
- Task Board (not Kanban or Project Board)
- Quick Actions (not Shortcuts or Commands)

**Roles:**
- Admin (full permissions)
- Member (standard user)
- Guest (view-only)
```

### 2. User Personas

Include realistic personas Antigravity can reference:

```markdown
# User Personas

**Sarah Chen - Enterprise Admin**
- Role: Product lead at 500-person company
- Needs: Team management, security, audit logs
- Pain points: Onboarding new team members

**Mike Rodriguez - Individual Contributor**
- Role: Software engineer
- Needs: Personal task tracking, quick entry
- Pain points: Context switching between tools
```

### 3. Writing & Output Preferences

Set your documentation standards:

```markdown
# Writing Guidelines

- Use active voice ("Create a task" not "A task can be created")
- Include Oxford commas in lists
- Write in second person ("you" not "the user")
- Keep paragraphs under 4 sentences
- Use markdown formatting (bold for emphasis, code blocks for UI)
```

### 4. Product Context

Help Antigravity understand your tech and features:

```markdown
# Product Context

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: React, TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js, PostgreSQL
- Infrastructure: AWS, Docker

**Key Features:**
- Real-time collaboration
- Custom workflows
- Third-party integrations (Slack, GitHub, Figma)
```

## 🎯 When Rules Help

### Perfect For

- **Consistent terminology** - Always use "Workspace" not "Project"
- **Persona-driven examples** - Reference Sarah, Mike, Alex in outputs
- **Brand voice** - Match your company's writing style automatically
- **Team conventions** - PRD structure, meeting note format, doc standards
- **Product knowledge** - Tech stack, features, competitive positioning

### When to Skip

- **One-off projects** - Not worth setup time for temporary work
- **Highly variable context** - When every task needs different context
- **Personal experimentation** - When you're just testing Antigravity features

**Rule of thumb:** If you'd put it in a new teammate's onboarding doc, put it in project rules.

## 💡 Best Practices

### Keep Rules Focused

**❌ Too broad:**
```markdown
Make everything good and professional
```

**✅ Specific:**
```markdown
Use active voice and Oxford commas in all product documentation
```

### Update as Product Evolves

- Add new features to terminology section
- Update personas when target users change
- Refine writing style based on team feedback

### Use Multiple Files for Organization

```
.agent/rules/
├── terminology.mdc       # Product vocabulary
├── personas.mdc          # User profiles
├── writing-style.mdc     # Documentation standards
└── tech-context.mdc      # Stack and architecture
```

### Test Your Rules

Create the same document twice (before/after adding rules) to verify rules improve output quality.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Rules aren't applying to my chat"
**Fix:** Rules load at session start. Close and reopen the chat panel (Cmd+L) to reload with new rules.

### "Antigravity ignores specific rules"
**Fix:** Rules guide behavior but don't guarantee it. Be explicit in prompts: "Following our terminology rules, write..." If consistently ignored, make the rule more specific.

### "Too many rules - outputs feel constrained"
**Fix:** Rules should guide, not restrict. Keep to 1-2 pages max. Remove overly prescriptive rules that limit Antigravity's helpfulness.

### "Can't find .agent folder"
**Fix:** The folder is hidden by default. In file explorer, show hidden files or create manually: Right-click project root → New Folder → `.agent/rules/`
