# Module 0.1: Introduction to Antigravity for PMs
## Reference Guide

- **Time to Complete:** 10 minutes
- **Prerequisites:** None

## 📖 Overview

Antigravity is Google's free agentic IDE that transforms how Product Managers work with documents, data, and text. Unlike traditional coding tools, Antigravity lets PMs use AI to create, edit, and analyze files through natural conversation—no terminal commands required.

**This course is done entirely in Antigravity.** You'll learn Antigravity by using Antigravity—the course materials open in the application, and Gemini guides you through interactive lessons inside the editor.

**Key takeaway:** Antigravity saves PMs 10-20 hours per week by automating document creation, research analysis, meeting note processing, and repetitive PM work.

## Who This Course Is For

**Perfect for:**
- Product Managers at any level
- Product designers working on documentation
- PMs new to AI tools
- PMs switching from ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini web apps

**Not ideal for:**
- Engineers (you probably know Antigravity already)
- People looking for coding tutorials
- Teams needing collaboration features (Antigravity is individual-focused)

## Course Structure

**You'll take this course inside Antigravity itself:**
- Download course files and open them in Antigravity
- Type slash commands (like `/start-1-1`) to begin modules
- Gemini guides you step-by-step through interactive lessons
- You DO the work (write PRDs, analyze data) using Antigravity's features

All exercises use **TaskFlow**, a fictional project management SaaS company (think "Asana meets Linear"). You'll practice with:
- Realistic PRDs, meeting notes, and user research
- Actual PM deliverables, not toy examples
- Business context that mirrors real startup work

**Your role:** Senior PM for activation and onboarding at TaskFlow, a Series B startup with $2.5M ARR and 10,000 users.

## What Antigravity Does for PMs

Antigravity combines a familiar text editor interface with powerful AI capabilities specifically useful for Product Management work.

**Core capabilities:**

| Feature | What PMs Use It For |
|---------|-------------------|
| **@ Mentions** | Reference files, folders, docs, or codebase in conversation |
| **Editor view** | Multi-file editing and creation with AI assistance |
| **Planning mode** | Complex multi-step workflows and project orchestration |
| **Project Rules** | Set context and AI behavior for your projects |
| **Templates** | Reusable document structures |

**What makes it different:**
- **Visual interface** - See your files, folders, and changes (not just terminal text)
- **File system integration** - AI works directly with your actual files
- **Persistent context** - AI remembers your project setup via `.agent/rules` files
- **Beginner-friendly** - No coding or command-line experience needed
- **Completely free** - Google's Antigravity is free to use

## Real-World PM Use Cases

### Strategic Work
- **PRD authoring** - Generate first drafts from meeting notes or research
- **Roadmap planning** - Analyze feedback and synthesize into priorities
- **Competitive analysis** - Structure research into comparison matrices
- **User research synthesis** - Process interview transcripts into insights

### Execution
- **Ticket creation** - Transform PRD sections into Jira/Linear stories
- **Data formatting** - Convert spreadsheets, clean CSVs, restructure tables
- **File organization** - Batch rename, reorganize, or restructure folders
- **Documentation** - Create onboarding docs, process maps, wikis

### Communication
- **Stakeholder updates** - Generate status reports from various sources
- **Release notes** - Draft user-facing changelogs from ticket lists
- **Presentations** - Build slide outlines or speaker notes
- **Meeting notes** - Process and summarize recordings or transcripts

### Research & Analysis
- **User feedback** - Analyze support tickets, reviews, or survey responses
- **Competitor tracking** - Structure competitive intelligence into usable formats
- **Market research** - Synthesize industry reports or trend analysis

## Time Savings Breakdown

**Typical weekly savings:**

| Task | Before Antigravity | With Antigravity | Saved |
|------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| PRD first draft | 4-6 hours | 1-2 hours | 3-4 hours |
| Meeting note processing | 2-3 hours | 30 min | 2 hours |
| Research synthesis | 4-5 hours | 1-2 hours | 3 hours |
| Documentation updates | 2-3 hours | 45 min | 2 hours |
| Ticket creation | 3-4 hours | 1 hour | 2-3 hours |
| **Total** | **15-21 hours** | **5-7 hours** | **12-15 hours** |

## Course Time Investment

**Foundation Level (Modules 0-1):**
- Setup and basics: 2-3 hours
- Returns: Immediate time savings on basic tasks

**Intermediate Level (Module 2):**
- Real PM workflows: 3-4 hours
- Returns: Handle complex multi-file work

**Advanced Level (Module 3):**
- Advanced techniques: 2-3 hours
- Returns: Orchestrate complex projects

**Total: 7-10 hours for full mastery**

**ROI:** After one week, you'll have saved more time than you invested.

## The Mindset Shift

### From Manual Executor to Orchestrator

**Before Antigravity:**
1. Open file
2. Copy content
3. Paste into ChatGPT
4. Copy response back
5. Manual formatting
6. Repeat for each file

**With Antigravity:**
1. Ask AI to work with your files
2. AI handles everything
3. Review and refine

**Example:**
- **Old way:** Spend 3 hours manually creating 20 user story tickets from a PRD
- **Antigravity way:** "Create Jira stories from this PRD using our ticket template" (15 minutes)

### Conversation Over Commands

Antigravity doesn't require learning terminal commands or coding syntax. You work with AI through natural conversation:

- ❌ Don't need: `grep -r "TODO" . | awk '{print $1}'`
- ✅ Just say: "Find all TODO items across these files"

### Persistent Context

Unlike web chatbots, Antigravity remembers your project setup:

- **Project rules** define how AI should behave
- **File references** stay accessible without re-uploading
- **Templates** standardize outputs across your team
