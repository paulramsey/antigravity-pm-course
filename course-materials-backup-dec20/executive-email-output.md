**Subject:** Critical Onboarding Drop-off - Research Findings & Recommendations

We recently completed a deep-dive into our onboarding flow, analyzing 12 interviews and 200+ survey responses. The data reveals a significant strategic gap: 40% of our new users create solo workspaces and churn at 3x the rate of collaborative teams, representing a monthly MRR loss of over $4,000.

The core issue is a value proposition disconnect. Many users treat TaskFlow as a personal task app and skip the team invitation step because the UI lacks prominence and clarity. Our current flow inadvertently encourages skipping, leading to a 73% skip rate and an annual lost revenue impact of approximately $48,000 if left unaddressed.

I recommend we immediately redesign the team invite step to emphasize collaborative value and implement a 24-hour follow-up email for those who skip. These changes aim to reduce solo workspace creation to 25% and could save an estimated $24,000 in annual MRR. We need approval to prioritize these onboarding improvements alongside the Q2 roadmap.
