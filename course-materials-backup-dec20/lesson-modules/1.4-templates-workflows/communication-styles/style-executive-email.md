## Example

**Subject:** Dark Mode Feature - Customer Research Findings

We completed user research on dark mode with 15 enterprise customers representing $450K ARR. This feature came up unprompted in 12/15 conversations as a blocker to broader team adoption.

The data is compelling: 80% of enterprise users work outside standard hours, and all cited eye strain as a productivity issue. Three customers (DataCorp, FinStack, MediaHub) have explicitly tied contract renewals to this feature. The pattern is clear - dark mode isn't a nice-to-have for enterprise, it's table stakes for teams working async across timezones.

I recommend we prioritize dark mode for Q2. Engineering estimates 2 sprints, and early delivery could unlock $200K in expansion revenue from customers waiting on this. I need your input on whether we pull forward from Q3 roadmap or add resources to run parallel.
