# Product Team Sync - May 15, 2024

**Attendees:** Sarah (PM), Alex (Eng Lead), Jamie (Design), Marcus (Marketing)

**Agenda:** Q2 roadmap priorities, dark mode feature discussion, onboarding flow improvements

---

## Dark Mode Feature

**Alex:** Engineering looked at dark mode scope. Two sprints if we do basic implementation. Four sprints if we want feature-complete with user preferences, scheduling, system-based switching.

**Sarah:** Customer research came back strong. 12 out of 15 enterprise customers mentioned it unprompted. Three explicitly said it's blocking broader team rollout. DataCorp, FinStack, and MediaHub - that's $450K ARR.

**Jamie:** Design has explorations ready. Did audit of Asana, Linear, Notion approaches. Linear's implementation is cleanest - system-based default with manual override. We could ship basic version in two sprints, iterate on preferences later.

**Marcus:** Sales team asking about this weekly. It's come up in last 8 enterprise demos. Prospects expect it as table stakes. Not having it makes us look behind.

**Decision:** Prioritize dark mode for Q2. Start with basic implementation (2 sprints), ship fast, iterate based on usage data.

**Action items:**
- Alex: Finalize tech spec by May 20
- Jamie: Complete design handoff by May 18
- Sarah: Update roadmap and communicate to stakeholders
- Marcus: Prepare launch messaging

## Onboarding Flow Improvements

**Sarah:** Analytics show 40% drop-off at team invite step. Users creating workspace but not inviting team members. That's a leading indicator for churn.

**Jamie:** We buried the team invite. It's on second screen but users skip it. Could make it required, or at least more prominent.

**Alex:** Could trigger email reminder if user skips invite step. "TaskFlow works better with your team" type nudge after 24 hours.

**Marcus:** Sales feedback - users don't understand value prop until they collaborate. Solo usage doesn't showcase our strength.

**Decision:** Two-part approach. Jamie redesigns invite flow to be more prominent (not required, but clearer value prop). Alex builds 24-hour email reminder if skipped.

**Action items:**
- Jamie: Redesign invite step with clearer benefits copy
- Alex: Implement email reminder job
- Sarah: Define success metrics (target: reduce skip rate from 40% to 25%)
- Ship target: End of May
