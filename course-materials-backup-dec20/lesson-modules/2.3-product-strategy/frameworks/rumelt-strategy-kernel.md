# Rumelt's Strategy Kernel Framework

## Overview

Richard Rumelt's Strategy Kernel is one of the clearest, most actionable frameworks for product strategy. It cuts through vague vision statements and forces you to think rigorously about the hard choices that define real strategy.

**Source:** *Good Strategy/Bad Strategy* by Richard Rumelt (2011)

**Core Insight:** Good strategy isn't about goals, vision, or aspirations. It's about diagnosing a critical challenge, choosing an overall approach, and designing coherent actions to carry out that approach.

## The Three Components

Good strategy has three essential components, called the **Strategy Kernel**:

### 1. DIAGNOSIS

**What it is:** A clear, honest assessment of the critical challenge or opportunity you face.

**The goal:** Simplify the overwhelming complexity of reality by identifying the critical aspects of your situation.

**Questions to answer:**
- What's the core problem or opportunity?
- What's changing in the market or competitive landscape?
- What's the fundamental difficulty we must overcome?
- What constraints do we face? (resources, time, capabilities)

**Characteristics of good diagnosis:**
- ✅ Based on facts and data, not wishes
- ✅ Identifies the **crux** - the pivotal challenge that matters most
- ✅ Cuts through noise to highlight what's critical
- ✅ Often surprising or counterintuitive when done well
- ✅ Explains why the current situation exists

**Example (TaskFlow AI Strategy):**
- **Bad diagnosis:** "We need to do more with AI"
- **Good diagnosis:** "Notion, Linear, and Asana are racing to ship AI features for enterprise and mid-market customers, but none are focused on small teams (5-20 people). We have 2 engineers and $50k budget - we can't match their breadth, but we can win a niche they're ignoring."

**Why this matters:** You can't solve a problem you don't understand. Most bad strategy starts with fuzzy diagnosis.

---

### 2. GUIDING POLICY

**What it is:** Your overall approach for dealing with the challenge identified in the diagnosis.

**The goal:** Define the **general method** you'll use to overcome the obstacles and seize opportunities.

**This is NOT:**
- ❌ A list of specific actions or features
- ❌ A goal or target ("grow 50%!")
- ❌ A vision statement ("be the best!")

**This IS:**
- ✅ The overall approach or method
- ✅ A choice that creates advantage
- ✅ Often defines what you **won't** do (focus requires saying no)
- ✅ Channels action in certain directions while ruling out others

**Questions to answer:**
- How will we approach this challenge?
- What's our overall method or direction?
- What tradeoffs are we making?
- What are we choosing NOT to do?

**Example (TaskFlow AI Strategy):**
- **Bad guiding policy:** "Build amazing AI features that delight customers"
- **Good guiding policy:** "Focus AI development on SMB-specific needs (simplicity, affordability, fast setup) rather than competing on enterprise feature breadth. Leverage our voice chat strength as differentiation. Subsidize AI to drive activation rather than monetize immediately."

**Why this matters:** The guiding policy is where you make **hard strategic choices**. It's uncomfortable because you're ruling things out. But that's exactly what creates focus and advantage.

---

### 3. COHERENT ACTIONS

**What it is:** A set of coordinated actions designed to carry out the guiding policy.

**The goal:** Translate your strategic approach into concrete, feasible steps that reinforce each other.

**Characteristics of coherent actions:**
- ✅ Multiple actions that **work together** (coherent!)
- ✅ Each action supports the guiding policy
- ✅ They're mutually reinforcing, not scattered
- ✅ Specific enough to be implemented
- ✅ Resource-realistic (can actually be done with your constraints)

**Questions to answer:**
- What specific initiatives will we pursue?
- What features will we build? (roadmap)
- How will we allocate resources?
- What's the timeline?
- How do these actions reinforce each other?

**Example (TaskFlow AI Strategy):**
- **Bad coherent actions:** "Build AI summaries, AI search, AI chat, AI suggestions, AI analytics..." (scattered, not coherent)
- **Good coherent actions:**
  - **Q1 2026:** Ship AI voice-to-task creation (doubles down on voice strength, targets SMB simplicity)
  - **Q1 2026:** Launch AI smart daily digest (helps activation/retention, our company priority)
  - **Q2 2026:** Add AI project health scoring (unique to SMBs who lack PM expertise)
  - **Q2 2026:** Partner with OpenAI for advanced capabilities (leverage others' investment)
  - **All quarters:** Include AI free in all plans (subsidize for growth, not revenue)
  - **All quarters:** Focus on 2-minute setup experiences (SMB constraint: no time for complex onboarding)

**Why this matters:** Actions that don't reinforce each other waste resources and dilute impact. Coherence multiplies effectiveness.

## How to Use This Framework

### Step 1: Start with Diagnosis
- Gather competitive intelligence
- Analyze your constraints (resources, capabilities, time)
- Identify the critical challenge or opportunity
- Write a 2-3 paragraph diagnosis that explains the situation clearly

### Step 2: Develop Guiding Policy
- Based on your diagnosis, what's your overall approach?
- Make hard choices: What will you focus on? What will you NOT do?
- Ensure your policy addresses the challenge identified in diagnosis
- Write a 1-2 paragraph guiding policy statement

### Step 3: Design Coherent Actions
- What specific initiatives implement your guiding policy?
- Do they reinforce each other?
- Can you realistically execute them with your resources?
- Create a roadmap showing how actions unfold over time

### Step 4: Test for Coherence
- Read diagnosis → guiding policy → coherent actions in sequence
- Does the guiding policy clearly address the diagnosis?
- Do the coherent actions clearly implement the guiding policy?
- Do actions reinforce each other or pull in different directions?
- If something doesn't fit, revise until coherent

## What Makes a Strategy "Good" vs "Bad"?

### Bad Strategy (Rumelt's Four Hallmarks)

**1. Fluff:** Gibberish masquerading as strategic concepts
- "Leverage synergies to maximize stakeholder value"
- "Be customer-obsessed and innovation-driven"

**2. Failure to Face the Challenge:** Diagnosis missing or superficial
- Doesn't identify the actual obstacles
- Pretends problems don't exist

**3. Mistaking Goals for Strategy:** Ambition without method
- "Grow revenue 50% next year" (goal, not strategy)
- "Become the market leader" (aspiration, not strategy)

**4. Bad Strategic Objectives:** Incoherent, unconnected actions
- Long laundry list of things to do
- Actions don't reinforce each other
- Spreads resources too thin

### Good Strategy Checklist

✅ **Clear diagnosis** that explains the critical challenge
✅ **Guiding policy** that channels efforts in a coherent direction
✅ **Coherent actions** that are feasible and mutually reinforcing
✅ **Hard choices** explicitly made (focus = saying no)
✅ **Acknowledges constraints** (resources, time, capabilities)
✅ **Creates advantage** through focus and coherence

## Common Mistakes PMs Make

### Mistake 1: Skipping Diagnosis
- Jumping straight to solutions without understanding the problem
- **Fix:** Force yourself to write diagnosis first, get feedback before moving on

### Mistake 2: Confusing Vision with Guiding Policy
- "Be the best project management tool!" ← Not a guiding policy
- **Fix:** Guiding policy describes HOW, not WHAT you aspire to be

### Mistake 3: Incoherent Actions
- Building features that don't reinforce each other
- **Fix:** Draw a diagram showing how actions connect and support each other

### Mistake 4: Not Making Hard Choices
- Trying to do everything for everyone
- **Fix:** For every strategic choice, explicitly state what you're NOT doing

### Mistake 5: Unrealistic Actions
- Coherent actions require resources you don't have
- **Fix:** Test actions against actual constraints (budget, team size, timeline)

## Real-World Example: Netflix (circa 2007)

### Diagnosis
- DVD-by-mail business model is threatened by digital streaming technology
- Incumbent competitors (Blockbuster) have brand and retail advantages
- Bandwidth costs are dropping, making streaming economically viable
- **Critical challenge:** Transition to streaming before competitors do, without destroying DVD business too fast

### Guiding Policy
- Build streaming capability while maintaining DVD revenue
- Focus on content licensing as competitive moat (not technology)
- Gradually shift customer attention and investment toward streaming
- Don't compete on price - compete on catalog breadth and user experience

### Coherent Actions
- Launch streaming as **free add-on** to DVD subscribers (doesn't cannibalize immediately)
- Invest heavily in content licensing deals (especially older catalog titles)
- Build streaming technology in-house (control user experience)
- Keep DVD service excellent during transition (don't alienate current customers)
- Market "Watch Instantly" as bonus feature, not replacement
- Gradually shift pricing to favor streaming over time

**Result:** Successful multi-year transition from DVD to streaming, while competitors failed to adapt.

**Why it worked:** Coherence. Every action reinforced the guiding policy. They didn't try to do everything at once.
