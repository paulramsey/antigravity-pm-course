# User Research Insights: TaskFlow Performance & Feature Gaps

After analyzing 8 user interviews across a variety of personas (Engineering, Design, Marketing, Sales, and Product), we have identified significant recurring themes. While our speed and performance remain a competitive advantage, several critical gaps are impacting user retention and expansion.

## Top 3 Pain Points

### 1. Lack of Template Library (The "Blank Screen" Problem)
Almost every persona highlighted the frustration of manually recreating recurring project structures. This leads to a slow learning curve for new users and significant time waste for power users.
*   **Supporting Quote (James, CSM):** *"The amount of time I spend recreating the same project structure for each customer is ridiculous. I've literally copy-pasted the same project structure 15 times this quarter."*
*   **Supporting Quote (Priya, Junior PM):** *"I created my first project and was like... now what? I didn't know the best practices... I wish TaskFlow had given me some starter templates to learn from."*
*   **Supporting Quote (Sarah, Marketing):** *"I rebuild this structure every single time... I'd save probably 30 minutes per campaign, we do 3-4 campaigns a month."*

### 2. Notification Overload
Users are drowning in "noisy" notifications, receiving between 30 and 70 alerts per day. This has forced most participants to mute notifications entirely, causing them to miss critical, time-sensitive updates.
*   **Supporting Quote (David, Engineer):** *"Ugh. Too many. I get emails for everything... Someone breathes near a task I'm watching, I get an email. I've basically turned most notifications off."*
*   **Supporting Quote (Marcus, Sales Ops):** *"I get probably 60-70 notifications a day... But then sometimes I miss a critical update - like, legal has a question blocking a deal."*
*   **Supporting Quote (Maya, Designer):** *"The notifications are a bit much... I'd love a way to only get notified about design-critical stuff."*

### 3. Highly Requested "Quality of Life" Features (Dark Mode & Mobile)
While seemingly "cosmetic," the lack of Dark Mode and a subpar mobile experience are the top complaints from users who work late or travel frequently.
*   **Supporting Quote (Maya, Designer):** *"Oh man, the lack of dark mode is killing me. I work late, and that bright white interface is harsh."*
*   **Supporting Quote (Marcus, Sales Ops):** *"I travel constantly... the mobile experience is rough... I end up waiting until I'm back at my hotel to do updates."*
*   **Supporting Quote (David, Engineer):** *"Dark mode. Hands down... I check tasks on my phone sometimes and it's not great - too much scrolling, hard to read context."*

## Summary Recommendation
To drive growth and increase user activation, we should prioritize the **Template Library** (to solve the onboarding hurdle) and **Notification Triage/Digests** (to restore the value of alerts). Concurrently, shipping **Dark Mode** would provide a major boost to user morale and retention for our most active users.
