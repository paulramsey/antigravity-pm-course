# User Research: Pain Points

## Overview
Recent user interviews have identified several key areas where TaskFlow can improve.

## 1. Complexity Overwhelm
Users feel that as projects grow, the interface becomes cluttered and hard to navigate. They need ways to quickly capture information without being overwhelmed by the full project view.

## 2. Need for Quick Task Capture
Many users report wanting to add tasks while on the go or during meetings without breaking their flow.
- *Quote:* "I often have an idea or a task while I'm walking or in a meeting, but by the time I open the app and find the right place, I've lost the thought or the momentum."

## 3. Asynchronous Communication Gaps
Remote teams struggle with the "meeting tax." They want more ways to share updates and context without needing a live call.

## 4. Reporting Friction
Managers feel it takes too much time to get a high-level view of project health and team workload.
