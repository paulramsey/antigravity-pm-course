# Socratic Questioning Framework

This framework is designed to help PMs sharpen their thinking by answering strategic questions about a feature idea.

## The Questions

1. **The 'Why' Question:** What is the core job-to-be-done that this feature solves? Why is this a problem worth solving *now*?
2. **The Strategic Fit Question:** How does this feature align with our current company strategy and competitive positioning?
3. **The Risk Question:** What is the biggest risk (technical, market, or UX) and how can we mitigate it early?
4. **The Success Question:** If this feature is a massive success, what specifically changes for our users?
5. **The Alternative Question:** How are users solving this problem today, and why is our solution 10x better?
