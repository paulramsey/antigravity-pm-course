# H1 2026 AI Product Strategy: Executive Review

## Slide 1: Voice-First AI is Our Path to Dominance in the Underserved SMB Market
*   TaskFlow can't win a general feature arms race against Notion and Linear.
*   We will dominate the 5-20 person team segment by building the first truly frictionless voice-to-task experience.
*   **Goal:** Turn TaskFlow into the "Siri for Productivity."

## Slide 2: Competitors Are Overlooking Small Teams in Favor of Enterprise Complexity
*   **Notion:** Moving toward complex "AI Agents" for large-scale knowledge management.
*   **Linear:** Deeply focused on technical velocity for elite engineering teams.
*   **Asana:** Optimized for enterprise PMOs and complex cross-functional coordination.
*   **The Gap:** No one is building AI that makes task management invisible for busy 5-20 person teams.

## Slide 3: Our 2-Engineer Team Requires Hyper-Specialization to Maintain Velocity
*   We have $50k and 2 full-stack engineers; we cannot match Notion's 100+ engineer breadth.
*   We will ignore broad "AI Writing" to focus 100% on voice-driven capture and automation.
*   Antigravity will be used as a development multiplier to maintain the perception of high feature velocity.

## Slide 4: Voice-to-Task Solves the Primary Friction Point for Mobile-First SMBs
*   70% of our active users are remote/mobile teams who already use our voice infrastructure.
*   Recording a voice task is 4x faster than navigating a UI to type one.
*   Strategic Choice: We are betting on voice as the "killer app" for task creation.

## Slide 5: Strategic Choice: We Will Build Faster Through Specialized Focus
*   Instead of catching up on old features, we are leapfrogging competitors on the voice interaction model.
*   **Choice:** Match overall velocity perception by shipping specialized voice features every 2 weeks.
*   **Trade-off:** We will intentionally lack broad AI features (like database summaries) to win on voice simplicity.

## Slide 6: Subsidizing AI Adoption is Critical for H1 Activation Goals
*   Company priority is activation and retention, not immediate revenue.
*   We will include core AI features free (subsidized by our $50k H1 budget).
*   **Target:** 30%+ AI feature adoption to drive 15% improvement in Q1 retention.

## Slide 7: AI Will Be an Enhancement to TaskFlow, Not a Product Pivot
*   We are not building a standalone AI tool; we are making TaskFlow "smart."
*   AI will integrated into the existing mobile app and voice chat workflows.
*   This lowers user friction and leverages our existing active user base.

## Slide 8: Q1 2026 Focus: Shipping the "Siri for TaskFlow" Engine
*   **Action:** Launch the AI Voice-to-Task engine using OpenAI's Whisper API.
*   **Benefit:** Allows 100% hands-free creation of tasks with auto-assignment.
*   **Velocity:** First beta release to 1,000 teams by mid-February.

## Slide 9: Q2 2026 Focus: Voice-Readable Daily Digests Drive Retention
*   AI will synthesize daily activity into a 60-second audio summary.
*   Teams can "listen to their project status" during morning commutes.
*   Creates a daily habit that competitors' text-heavy UIs can't match.

## Slide 10: High Quality Voice Recognition is Our Only Defensible Path
*   We are choosing "Deliberate and Defensible" over "Experimental Chaos."
*   We will only ship voice features that hit 95%+ accuracy (Whisper benchmark).
*   If we fail on quality, we lose the simplicity advantage.

## Slide 11: Success in H1 2026 is Defined by 3 Core Metrics
*   **Activation:** 20% increase in teams completing 5+ tasks in their first 7 days.
*   **Retention:** 15% reduction in churn for teams using voice-to-task features.
*   **Efficiency:** Maintaining bi-weekly ship cycles with only 2 engineers.

## Slide 12: We Are Requesting Continued $50k Investment to Secure the SMB Niche
*   The strategy is coherent: Voice Focus + High Velocity + Subsidized Adoption.
*   This plan maximizes our 2-engineer resource while avoiding a direct battle with Notion/Asana.
*   **Next Step:** Approve Q1 API budget and kickoff Whisper integration on Jan 2nd.
