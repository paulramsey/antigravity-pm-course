# Onboarding User Research - May 2024

**Author:** Sarah Chen, Senior PM

## Overview
This document summarizes research findings from 12 user interviews and 200+ survey responses regarding the onboarding flow. It identifies a critical drop-off point at the team invitation step and provides data-driven recommendations to improve retention.

## Background / Context
Despite steady signups, 30-day retention has been lagging. We conducted this research to understand where users are losing interest and why collaborative features aren't being fully utilized from day one.

## Key Findings

### The "Solo User" Churn Pattern
- **40%** of new workspaces have only 1 member after 7 days.
- Solo users churn at **68%** vs. **22%** for teams.
- Insight: Users often view TaskFlow as a personal app rather than a team collaboration tool.

### Invitation Flow Friction
- **73%** of users click "Skip for now" during onboarding.
- Only **12%** return later to invite their team.
- The UI currently makes skipping the easiest path.

### Competitive Context
- **Linear & Notion:** Both emphasize the "workspace" and "team" concepts much earlier and more aggressively than TaskFlow.

## Implications
1. **Revenue Risk:** At current rates, solo user churn costs ~$4,080/month in lost MRR.
2. **Product Value:** Users aren't experiencing the "aha" moment that comes from collaboration.

## Recommendations / Next Steps

**Redesign Team Invite Step & Follow-up**
- Make the invite step more prominent with updated copy ("TaskFlow works best with your team").
- Implement a 24-hour "nudge" email for users who skip the invite.

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Redesign invite flow - Target May 18 (Owner: Jamie)
- [ ] Build reminder email - Target May 20 (Owner: Alex)
- [ ] Baseline solo-to-team conversion metrics (Owner: Sarah)
