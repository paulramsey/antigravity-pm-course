## Product Philosophy

**Core Principles:**
1. **Async-first:** Built for distributed teams, not real-time meetings
2. **Context over status:** Every task has full context (no "what's this for?")
3. **Speed matters:** Sub-second page loads, no spinners
4. **Opinionated but flexible:** Strong defaults, customizable when needed
5. **Beautiful and functional:** Design quality matters

## Key Terminology

Use these terms consistently:

- **Workspace** (NOT "Project" at top level)
- **Project** (collections of tasks)
- **Task** (individual work item)
- **Epic** (large feature spanning multiple tasks)
- **Cycle** (our word for sprint - 2 weeks)

## Competitive Position

**Primary Competitors:**
- Asana (too complex, expensive)
- Linear (too engineering-focused)
- Monday.com (overwhelming, expensive)
- ClickUp (cluttered, slow)

**Our Differentiation:**
- Balanced (not too simple, not too complex)
- Async-first (built in, not bolted on)
- Fast & polished (Linear-level quality, Asana-level features)

## Current Priorities (Q1 2025)

1. **Mobile app launch** (iOS & Android)
2. **Enterprise features** (SSO, advanced permissions, audit logs)
3. **Activation improvements** (your focus as the PM!)
4. **Dark mode** (highly requested)

## Course Structure
