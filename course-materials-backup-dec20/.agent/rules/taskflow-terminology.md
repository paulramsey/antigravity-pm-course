# TaskFlow Terminology and Style Guidelines

## Core Terminology
Always use these terms precisely to ensure consistency across all TaskFlow documentation:

- **Workspace**: The highest-level container. Use this instead of "Project", "Folder", or "Account" when referring to the main environment.
- **Task**: An individual unit of work. Use this instead of "To-do" or "Action item".
- **Cycle**: Our 2-week development sprint. Always use "Cycle" when referring to time-bound work periods.
- **Epic**: A collection of tasks representing a large feature.
- **Project**: A specific collection of tasks within a Workspace.

## User Personas
When writing examples or considering user impact, reference our primary personas:

- **Sarah (Enterprise Admin)**: Focused on security, SSO, audit logs, and managing team-wide permissions for large organizations.
- **Mike (IC Engineer)**: Values speed, keyboard shortcuts, GitHub integrations, and minimizing distractions for deep work.
- **Alex (Team Lead)**: Needs visibility across the team, workload balancing, and clear reporting on blockers.

## Writing Style & Voice
- **Tone**: Conversational yet professional. Avoid overly corporate jargon or "stiff" language.
- **Voice**: Use **Active Voice** (e.g., "Sarah shared the workspace" vs "The workspace was shared by Sarah").
- **Punctuation**: Use the **Oxford Comma** in all lists.
- **Emojis**: Do not use emojis in formal product updates or technical documentation.
- **Specificity**: Use real names (Sarah, Mike, Alex) in examples and include specific use cases rather than generalities.

## Output Preferences
- Always structure product updates with a clear "What's New", "Why We Built This", and "How to Get Started" hierarchy.
- When generating tasks, always consider if they should belong to an existing Epic or Cycle.
