# Product Update: Collaboration Reimagined with Workspace Sharing

We are thrilled to introduce Workspace Sharing, a core expansion of how teams collaborate within TaskFlow.

### What's New

TaskFlow now allows you to share your entire Workspace with internal team members and external stakeholders. We have implemented granular permission levels so you can control exactly who sees what, ensuring your documentation and tasks remain secure yet accessible.

*   **Granular Permissions**: Admins like Sarah can now set view-only, comment-only, or full edit access at the Workspace level.
*   **External Collaboration**: Securely invite partners or clients into specific Workspaces without compromising the rest of your organizational data.
*   **Centralized Invitations**: Manage all Workspace members from a single, streamlined dashboard.

### Why We Built This

At TaskFlow, our philosophy is "Context over status." We realized that siloed projects often led to information gaps. Alex, a Team Lead, needed a way to give his entire squad visibility into cross-functional initiatives without manually adding them to fifty individual projects. Meanwhile, Sarah required a way to ensure audit logs and security protocols were applied consistently across all team activities.

By moving sharing to the Workspace level, we've reduced the administrative overhead for leads while ensuring IC engineers like Mike have immediate access to the context they need for deep work, without waiting for manual invites.

### How to Get Started

To share your Workspace, navigate to the Workspace Settings and select the "Members & Sharing" tab. From there, you can invite new members via email and assign their specific roles.

We built this to help you move faster and stay aligned. We can't wait to see how your team uses Workspace Sharing to unblock your next big Cycle.

Best,
The TaskFlow Product Team
