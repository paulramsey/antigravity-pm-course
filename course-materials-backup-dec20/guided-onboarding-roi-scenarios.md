# ROI Scenarios: Guided Onboarding Feature

**Date:** December 2024
**Author:** Senior PM, Activation
**Objective:** Estimate business impact of Guided Onboarding to secure engineering resources.

## Key Assumptions & Inputs
Based on `taskflow-usage-data-q4.csv` and historical benchmarks:

- **Monthly Signups:** 350 users
- **Baseline Activation Rate:** 45%
- **Average LTV (Activated User):** $850
- **Engineering Cost:** $100,000 (2 engineers × 2 months × $25k/month)
- **Time Horizon:** 3 Years (standard for ROI calculations)

---

##  Scenario 1: Pessimistic (The "Disaster" Case)
*We build it, but adoption is low and it barely moves the needle.*

- **Adoption Rate:** 30% (Only 105 users/month try it)
- **Activation Lift:** +5pp (45% → 50%)
- **Incremental Activated Users:** ~5 users/month
- **Monthly Revenue Impact:** $4,460 (5 users × $850 LTV)
- **3-Year Revenue Impact:** $160,560

**ROI:** 1.6x
*(Even if this flops, we break even in ~2 years and make 60% profit over 3 years)*

---

## Scenario 2: Realistic (The "Target" Case)
*It works as expected, with solid adoption and meaningful improvement.*

- **Adoption Rate:** 70% (245 users/month use it)
- **Activation Lift:** +13pp (45% → 58%)
- **Incremental Activated Users:** ~32 users/month
- **Monthly Revenue Impact:** $27,072 (32 users × $850 LTV)
- **3-Year Revenue Impact:** $974,610

**ROI:** 9.7x
*(A highly efficient investment returning nearly $1M in value)*

---

## Scenario 3: Optimistic (The "Home Run" Case)
*Users love it, adoption is high, and it fundamentally fixes activation.*

- **Adoption Rate:** 90% (315 users/month use it)
- **Activation Lift:** +17pp (45% → 62%)
- **Incremental Activated Users:** ~54 users/month
- **Monthly Revenue Impact:** $45,517 (54 users × $850 LTV)
- **3-Year Revenue Impact:** $1,638,630

**ROI:** 16.4x
*(Transformative impact on the business)*

---

## Summary Recommendation
The model strongly supports moving forward. Even in the **Pessimistic scenario**, the project generates positive ROI (1.6x). In the Realistic scenario, it delivers nearly **10x ROI**.

**Recommendation:** Approve the 2-month engineering investment immediately.
