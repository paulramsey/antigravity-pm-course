# Experiment Readout: Guided Onboarding with Sample Project

**Date:** December 2024
**Experiment:** A/B Test (50/50 Split)
**Sample Size:** 8,000 Users (4k Control, 4k Treatment)
**Status:** Conclusion Reached

## Executive Summary
**Recommendation: SHIP to Small Teams (5-20), REVERT for Enterprise (100+)**

The Guided Onboarding experiment showed a modest +6.4pp lift overall, but this masked a massive success for our core segment. Small teams saw a **+11.4pp lift in activation** and a **3x increase in team invites**, while enterprise users saw a negative impact. The feature drives significantly higher user quality, with activated users completing **2.6x more tasks** in their first week.

## 1. Topline Results (The "Avg" View)
*Overall results looked statistically significant but underwhelming compared to our +13pp target.*

| Metric | Control | Treatment | Lift |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Activation Rate** | 45.2% | **51.6%** | **+6.4pp** |

## 2. Segmentation: The Real Story
*Breaking down by company size revealed the winning strategy.*

| Segment | Control | Treatment | Lift | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Small Teams (5-20)** | 44.8% | **56.2%** | **+11.4pp** | 🚀 **HUGE WIN** |
| **Mid-Market (21-99)** | 45.5% | 47.1% | +1.6pp | 😐 Neutral |
| **Enterprise (100+)** | 46.1% | 42.1% | -4.0pp | 📉 Negative |

**Insight:** Guided Onboarding solves the "blank slate" problem for self-serve teams, but creates friction for managed enterprise implementations.

## 3. Quality Metrics (Better Users)
*We didn't just get MORE users; we got BETTER users. Among activated users:*

| Metric | Control | Treatment | Lift |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Week 1 Retention** | 60% | **78%** | **+18pp** |
| **Avg Tasks (Wk 1)** | 2.7 | **7.2** | **2.6x** |

**Implication:** Treatment users are learning the product faster and becoming power users immediately.

## 4. Leading Indicators (Future Growth)
*These metrics predict long-term LTV and viral loops.*

| Metric | Control | Treatment | Lift |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Template Usage** | 10.9% | **34.7%** | **3.2x** |
| **Invite Rate** | 11.4% | **35.5%** | **3.1x** |

**Insight:** The sample project teaches users about templates and collaboration, triggering 3x more team invites.

## 5. Recommendation & Next Steps

1.  **Launch Immediate:** Roll out Guided Onboarding to 100% of **Small Teams (5-29 users)**.
2.  **Product Logic:** Disable Guided Onboarding for **Enterprise (100+)** signups (revert to old flow).
3.  **Investigate:** Launch a follow-up qualitative study with Mid-Market/Enterprise users to design a tailored "Admin Setup" flow for them.

**Expected Business Impact (Projected):**
- **Incremental Revenue:** ~$1.3M over 3 years (based on high-quality segment performance)
- **ROI:** >12x on engineering investment
